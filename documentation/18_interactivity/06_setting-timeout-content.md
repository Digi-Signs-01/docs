Setting timeout content
=======================

Signage can be used for several different purposes. Besides displaying ads, you may also trigger websites and let users interact with screens.

When you deal with interactive content, such as forms, websites, menus, mapping, you can't know for certain how long people will take to explore it.

When you are not sure about how long the Campaign should last, then it is better to publish longer Campaigns and set a Timeout on the Interactivity. The OnSign TV Â Player App will detected when no one has interacted with the Content for a certain period of time previously defined by you and trigger another Content automatically.

This is quite useful when displays are at high traffic areas. This way you can make sure that the next person interacting with the screen won't catch the Campaign mid-play.

For this tutorial, we have set up a wayfinding Campaign for a university. Visitors see the campus map and can click on departments to check out indoor maps. Our goal is to set up an Interactivity Timeout on department maps, so when no one is checking them out it goes back to the campus map.

Learn how to [create interactive Campaigns](/interactivity/create-interactive-campaigns).

1. In your OnSign TV account, right-click on the interactive Campaign where you want to set the Timeout.
2. Click on "Interactivity" on the pop-up menu.

4. As the **What**, select "Timeout".
5. Adjust how many seconds should pass without any interaction before OnSign TV triggers the main Content.
6. Select what will play if there is no interaction. You can trigger another Campaign, Playlist, or shift to an area of the ongoing Campaign.

7. At last, click on "Save".

Done! The outcome is, whenever there is no interaction with the department map for 15s, the Main Map will be triggered.
