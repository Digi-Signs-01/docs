Create interactive menus
========================

Create interactive menus for displaying your content separately and only when requested by the viewer through the click of a button. Divide long texts into smaller chunks and let your audience explore the content as they want, when they want, and in the order they prefer.

Supported on the OnSign TV  Player App for Android 4.2.0+ and Windows App 9.1.1+

For this tutorial, we will build the following Campaign:

![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731677342194/create-interactive-menus_1.gif)

[Download a prepared zip folder of files](https://docs.onsign.tv/resources/Storage/en/create-interactive-menus/Images-for-campaign-Create-interactive-menu-tutorial1.zip) to recreate the same Campaign yourself.

1. **Tip:** When creating your own Campaign, make a paper sketch before even opening your OnSign TV account . Plan in advance:  
   ![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731677394946/create-interactive-menus_2.png)
   * **How your content will be divided**. Define your Campaign's goal and split your content into different sections accordingly. Try designing different navigation maps and decide which one you think would work better.
   * **How many buttons you will need**. Each page requires a button or another action to trigger the next content on screen. Think about their design, where they will be placed on the screen and if it is clear it can be clicked!
   * **How your Campaign Layout will look like**. Give structural unity to your Campaign, even though there may be several different pages. Use colors, fonts, and layouts to make different pages look coherent. Read more about design in this [OnSign TV blog post](https://onsign.tv/blog/guidelines/6-primary-design-guidelines-digital-signage/).
2. When you are ready with your Campaign sketch, prepare your content. You are not able to trigger apps on screen. Therefore, if you plan on setting text as hidden content, create it in a software on your computer. Then, save it in an image format, such as JPEG, PNG, or even PDF. Design and insert media on every individual page.  
   Create an image containing all menu buttons (see image below). For this Campaign, we additionally created a standard background which will appear when no action is triggered.

3. Upload all files to your OnSign TV Account.  
   ![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731677512352/create-interactive-menus_4.jpg)
4. Create a new Campaign. Create the Custom Layout you have planned. For this tutorial, we planned two zones: a main content area (A) and a menu (B).  
   ![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731677525521/create-interactive-menus_5.jpg)
5. Drag the files to the Timeline.  
   ![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731677568452/create-interactive-menus_6.jpg)
6. Next, edit your Layout further by creating screen divisions where the buttons on the menu area will be.  
   ![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731677584042/create-interactive-menus_7.jpg)
7. Add a completely transparent image to these new areas in your Timeline to be able to save the Campaign. OnSign TV does not allow you to save a Campaign with empty timelines. The button’s text will be readable beneath the transparent image.  
   The transparent image must be in the PNG format ([learn more about transparency](/media/transparent-image-background)).  
   ![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731677597723/create-interactive-menus_8.jpg)
8. "Save" or directly "Save and Publish" the Campaign when you are done.
9. The view will change to a sidebar menu with the options edit, publish, or interactivity. Click on “Interactivity” on the sidebar menu.

10) Click on “Add Interaction” on the far right of the header for adding an action to each button.

This is the moment we give life to your Campaign! Let’s start with Region 3 (titled “What is digital signage?”) and turn it into a clickable area. Every time the user clicks on it, the content in Region 1 will be replaced by the “What is digital signage” PNG file:

Adjust the settings for the remaining areas:

12) Publish the Campaign to a Player if not done already and check out the result!
