How to impersonate a user’s account
===================================

Impersonation is a tool offered on the platform to have access to one of your user's account and assist when support is needed.

In the event, a user reports a Content playback error or a faulty Player, you can check their account without the need of a password and analyze the problem quickly.

1. Click on the “Orgs” tab in your branded digital signage platform.

2. Find the user on the list and click on the "Settings" gear icon. Then choose “Impersonate”.

3. The new page will display the user’s account, with all Content, Players, and settings they have set up. A colored line on the top of the page alerts you of impersonating a user.

   Remember that any action you perform during Impersonation is actually going to modify the user’s digital signage operation. So be careful. Do not delete Campaigns, nor remove Players.
4. To return to your own account, click on the user’s username on the bottom-left corner, then hit “Exit User Impersonation”.
