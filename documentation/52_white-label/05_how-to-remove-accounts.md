How to remove accounts
======================

When there is an ongoing conflict, non-payment from a client, or a subscription cancellation, you need to delete users from your account list.

In the event, you only temporarily want to prevent the user from accessing their account in expectation of a resolution, try merely [blocking the account](/white-label/how-to-block-accounts) instead.

1. In your branded digital signage account, click on the “Orgs” tab on your page menu on the left.

2. Search the list for the user and select the checkbox in front of the account.
3. Hit the red "Remove" button which appears in the header after selecting the user.

The user won’t be able to access their account any more and their content is completely erased. Nothing will be displayed on their screens.
