How to block accounts
=====================

Sometimes, you need to lose something in order to value it.

Warn users about unpaid subscriptions or other issues by blocking their accounts. This action will keep the client from accessing their account and modifying content while their signage operation remains working.

1. In your branded digital signage account, click on the “Orgs” tab on the left. For this tutorial, we are using the 123-Signage White Label account.

2. Find the specific account you want to keep from accessing your platform. Click on the "Settings" gear icon on the right, then hit “Block”.

You can quickly identify blocked accounts from active ones by their color. Blocked accounts are slightly faded.

When the conflict is resolved, you can re-activate the account anytime. Search for the the user and click the "Settings" gear icon. Then click “Unblock”.

The only way of stopping the user’s digital signage operation completely is by [removing their account](/white-label/how-to-remove-accounts).
