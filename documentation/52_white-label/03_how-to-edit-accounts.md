How to edit accounts
====================

Even after [having created your client’s account](/white-label/how-to-create-accounts), you can still change their account information anytime.

1. In your branded digital signage account, click on the “Orgs” tab on your page menu on the left.

2. Find the user whose settings you want to modify. If your client list is getting longer and longer, you can quickly search for the client through the search box on the top. Another option is reordering the list by criteria which make it easy for you to find this particular client.
3. Click on the gear icon to the right of the user’s name, then select “Edit” from the drop-down menu.
