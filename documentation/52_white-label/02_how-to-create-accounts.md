How to create accounts
======================

Manage several accounts for reselling.

In your branded digital signage account, you can create sub-accounts for your clients and assign Player licenses among these sub-accounts as you wish. The sub-accounts are called Orgs (Organizations). Set up your clients' accounts as follows:

1. Access your custom account URL. For this tutorial, we are using the 123-Signage White Label account.
2. Click on the “**Orgs**” tab. You will only see this option if you own a White Label account.

3. Click the “Add Organization”button on the top-right corner.

4. Fill out the client's info into the blanks. Here, you need to set the amount of Players your client will receive. You can always [edit this setting later on](/white-label/how-to-edit-accounts).

NOTE: If you don't have any vacant Player licenses available in your account, you need to [adjust your subscription](/billing/adjust-the-number-of-player-licenses).

You can also define whether the client will be able to set their logo on their Player App as shown in the image below. The logo will only appear when there is no Content playback.

5. Confirm with “Save Organization”.

The new user will be listed under "Orgs". You can check the client’s main account information, such as amount of Players as well as last time he logged into your service. This dashboard also allows you to access your client's account via [impersonation](/white-label/how-to-impersonate-a-user%E2%80%99s-account).
