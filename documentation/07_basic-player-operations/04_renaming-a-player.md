Renaming a player
=================

If you want to change a Player's name after it is already set up, there is no need for [disconnecting](/basic-player-operations/detaching-hardware-device) and [connecting the Player to your OnSign TV account](/basic-player-operations/connecting-a-player).

Follow this step-by-step instruction to rename a Player:

1. In your OnSign TV account, click on the "Players" tab. Select the Player you want to change the name of.
