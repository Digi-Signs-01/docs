Detaching a hardware device
===========================

Detaching a device is a simple procedure for disconnecting a hardware device associated with a Player name.

After detaching, the Player name will keep on being listed so that a new device can be later be paired with it.

If the goal is to just replace a hardware device, we suggest you to use the [Change Device Option](/basic-player-operations/replacing-a-hardware-device) as this will be an easier and faster process.

Steps for detaching a hardware device:

1. Go to the Player you want to detach.
2. Go to this Player's Settings.
3. In the header, you will find the yellow Change Device button. Next to it, is an arrow which opens up to the Detach Hardware option. Click on it.

4. As you have clicked on Detach Hardware, a pop-up to confirm appears.
5. Confirm with the red Detach Hardware button.

6. No device will be shown in the Player information anymore. In the Players overview, the profile will be highlighted in yellow. The Player will revert to displaying a code like it did during the connect-a-Player stage.

**Note:** A detached player profile still consumes a player license, unless you check the remove used license from this player option at the detachment confirmation.
