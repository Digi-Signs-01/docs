Connecting a player
===================

To connect a hardware device to your account, first you need to have a Player Software installed on your device - whether it is a tablet, a computer, or a media box.

Which Player Software you need, depends on your hardware device Operating System.

Download the Player Software for your OS from [downloads](https://onsign.tv/downloads/) and install it. Detailed instructions for installation on other operating systems can be found in our [tutorials](https://docs.onsign.com).

Once installed, connect a hardware device in 6 simple steps:

1. Open the software on your device. Write down the six-figure code displayed on the screen. You will need it later.

2. Log into your OnSign TV account and select “Players” from the left-hand menu.
3. Click on the orange “Setup Player” button in the top-right corner.

5. Give the Player a name. Complete additional info and settings as you prefer. You can always edit Player specific settings at any later time by clicking on the Players [tab](https://app.onsign.tv/device/) and selecting the corresponding Player. Confirm with "Add Player" at the bottom of the page.

6. Your Player is now ready to receive content to display! Because you have just set the Player up, a “no campaign assigned” message will be displayed on the screen.
