Adjust the number of player licenses
====================================

If your current OnSign TV subscription scope doesn’t meet your needs anymore, you can increase or decrease the number of Player licenses through your account in a few steps. Here is how:

1. Click on your username on the bottom-left corner of your OnSign TV account. Then select “Subscription” from the drop-down menu.

2. Click the “Change Subscription” button in the top-right corner.

3. On the newly loaded page, you see your current subscription. Click on "Edit Licenses" to open the editor. Adjust the number of Players you want to add or return.

As you increase or decrease the amount of Players, the value you will have to pay in the current and the following months will be clearly displayed below. For the current month, you will only be charged for the additional Players’ usage during the remaining days. If you decrease your licenses, you will receive a credit for the remaining days which will be applied to your next invoice.

There is a discount for subscriptions with more than 25 Players. Check the OnSign TV [pricing page](https://onsign.tv/pricing/) for more info.

Confirm with "Update to X licenses".

You cannot have more active Players associated with your account than your subscription allows. If you wish to decrease your player licenses, disconnect the Players in excess from your account first. For example: Delete three Players if you want to subscribe to 7 licenses from now on instead of 10. If you don't know how to remove Players, [refer to this tutorial](/basic-player-operations/detaching-hardware-device).

4. Click on "Update Subscription" to be guided to the payment profile.

Don’t leave the page until you have filled out the complete payment information, or else your purchase won’t be concluded.
