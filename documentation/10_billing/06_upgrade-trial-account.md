How to upgrade the trial account
================================

You haven’t subscribed to OnSign TV yet? [Send an email to our team](https://onsign.tv/support-submit-a-ticket/) if you have any questions about pricing and plans.

After the 14-day trial period, you won’t be able to access your OnSign TV account and modify content anymore. However the screens keep displaying them. After another 14 days, all your content will be removed, unless you subscribe to OnSign TV.

Learn how to become a OnSign TV user below:

1. In your trial account, click on your username on the bottom-left, then hit the orange [Upgrade Your Account! button](https://app.onsign.tv/subscription/upgrade/)
