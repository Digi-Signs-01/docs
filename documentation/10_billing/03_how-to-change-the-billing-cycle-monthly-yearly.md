How to change the billing cycle (monthly / yearly)
==================================================

When starting your subscription you decided on the billing cycle, whether you want to pay on a monthly basis or only once a year. The annual price saves you 10% compared to the monthly price. Compare prices on our [pricing list](https://onsign.tv/pricing/).

You can change the billing cycle from monthly to yearly or from yearly to monthly also when the subscription has already started. It takes a few steps, so bear with us. The result is seamless.

1. Change the Subscription
--------------------------

1. Click on your username on the bottom-left corner of your OnSign TV account. Then select “Subscription” from the drop-down menu.

2. Click the “Change Subscription” button in the top-right corner.

3. On the newly loaded page, you see your current subscription. Click on the blue button "Add New Subscription" in the center to open the editor.

4. By default, the New Subscription editor will present a monthly plan as you see in the radio button on top.

5. If you currently have a monthly subscription and want to change it to yearly, change the radio button from monthly to yearly. If you currently have a yearly subscription and want to change it to monthly, leave the radio button as is. In this tutorial we will assume we have a monthly subscription and want to change to yearly.  
   Then, click on "Choose this plan" when you have to make a choice between the Professional or the Enterprise plan. The difference between both plans is laid out in the table below.

6. By default, the new plan will show 5 licenses. Adjust it to the same number you currently have in your monthly, respective yearly subscription.

7. In our example we have 7 monthly licenses which we want to change to 7 yearly licenses, so we have to press the Plus symbol to get to 7 licenses.  
   As you increase or decrease the amount of licenses, the value you will have to pay in the current and the following months will be clearly displayed below. In this step, you will not be charged.

8. Confirm with "Update to X licenses". You will now see have two subscriptions. Now, let's remove the existing monthly subscription. Click on the "Edit Licenses" of the monthly subscription.

9. Lower the number to zero so that it turns red or directly click on the "Cancel Subscription" button.

10. Confirm the prompt with "Cancel".

11. Now, you will only have one subscription. Confirm with the orange button on the lower right bottom "Update Subscription". You will see the financial impact at the bottom. This consists of the full price of the new annual licenses minus the credit you will receive for the remaining now unused days of your monthly licenses.

2. Assign Licenses to the Players
---------------------------------

Last but not least, you need to assign the new licenses to the Players. This step may seem redundant for some, but for users who manage large networks this may matter. They need to be able to distinguish which license is attributed to each player.

1. Go to your [Players page](https://app.onsign.tv/players). The Players appear in red because they don't have a license assigned to them.
2. Please click on the checkboxes in front of the Players.
3. On top you will see a box called "Actions".

4. From there, click on "Change Subscription" to assign the newly bought licenses. This is the last step.
