Understanding how Credits Work
------------------------------

Whenever a subscription is removed a credit will be created and will be made available at your account. Credits and charges are listed within the “Billing History” menu.

Let’s go through an example to understand how credits work:

Let’s say you are currently subscribing for 30 Professional licenses at a price of $20/month.

* In case you remove 15 licenses 10 days before the end of the month.
* This means you will get a credit equivalent to: the number of licenses for the unused period (in this case 10/30).
* This way the credit would be calculated as: 15 licenses x 10/30 (unused period) x $20 price per license = $15 x $10/30 x $20 = $100

How to move licenses between Organizations
------------------------------------------

Moving licenses between organizations is accomplished by taking advantage of the credits received once licenses are unsubscribed.

Let’s go through a practical example:

* 15 licenses were removed from Org A, 10 days before the end of the month and creating a credit of $100.
* At the same day, 15 licenses new licenses of the same type are subscribed at any other Organization, this will apply charge of $100.

In other words, the credits and charges will cancel out, and no actual costs is applied to the account.
