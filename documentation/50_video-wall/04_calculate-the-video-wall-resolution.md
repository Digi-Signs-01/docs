Calculate the Video Wall resolution
===================================

There are several ways of arranging TV screens in order to create Video Walls: from two rows and two columns of screens (also called 2x2) over long TV rows (4x1, for instance) to mosaic. Whenever you deal with Video Walls, you need to take into account the total resolution created.

For a single Full HD screen (1920 x 1080px), you only need to create a Campaign and adjust the layout to your needs. In the case of a Video Wall, you have to sum up the width and height of all screens and create a [Custom Layout](/create-your-first-campaign/custom-resolution-to-match-your-display) with the resolution of the sums of the two sides.

See below several Video Wall setting examples and their custom resolutions:

For a mosaic Video Wall, you need to place each image in the Screen Layout divisions so they match their correspondent physical position. If you have a mosaic with two screens in portrait and two in landscape mode, you will need to place two images in portrait mode and the other two in landscape (confer the image below). When you see it in your OnSign TV account, the video will look completely distorted, but with the final arrangement of the screen positions on the wall, the image or video pieces will match:
