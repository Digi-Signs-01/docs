Aligning the screen
===================

If your Video Wall setup is using screens with some border or spaced out, the content shown in your screens will not be completely aligned without adjustments.

In this example we demonstrate how to calculate the horizontal offset adjustment to display aligned content on all screens.

As shown below we use same size screens with equal distance between each other.

After calculating the correct **X Offset values**, substitute the green fields in the video wall settings with the new values.
