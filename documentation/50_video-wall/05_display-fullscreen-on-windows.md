Display fullscreen on Windows
=============================

Display only what matters!

You will likely have other application bars on the screen besides the OnSign TV  Player App if you use a computer.

Follow the steps below and get rid of disturbing bars!

Very recent OnSign TV Player App for Windows versions, can be set to fullscreen directly in the Player Settings. For previous versions, please see the instructions in the second part.

These instructions apply to the OnSign TV  Player App for Windows 10.3.2 and above.

1. Go to your Player in your OnSign TV account and select the Settings menu.
2. Scroll almost to the bottom where you find the Window Configuration and toggle it on.

3. Choose Fullscreen for the OnSign TV Player App to take up the whole display.
