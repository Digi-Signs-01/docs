Adjusting MacOS settings
========================

Change the MacOS display settings to showcase Content on Video Walls.

After [building your Video Wall](/video-wall/how-to-build-a-video-wall) on a MacOS system, you still need to adjust your computer settings so the Content is displayed on all screens. Follow the instructions below and you will have your Video Wall up and running in no time:

1. Click on the "System Preferences" icon on your Mac desktop and select “Displays”.

2. In the top tab click on “Arrangement”. Uncheck the option “Mirror Displays”.
