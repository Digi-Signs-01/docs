How to build a Video Wall
=========================

A Video Wall is basically nothing else than multiple monitors assembled together to form a single large screen.

You can use OnSign TV for Video Walls. The content creation process is just about the same as if you were to publish it to a normal screen. There are just two minor things to pay attention: screen resolution and aspect ratio.

Below you get an overview of the technologies available. There are three different basic ways to build a Video Wall. Check them out:

1) Video Wall Controller
------------------------

This is the most basic Video Wall implementation. The Video Wall Controller is a small box with input options for one or more video feeds. The box will then split your video signal into multiple outputs. Depending on the Video Wall Controller, you can set the output to different formats. Example: 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 4x1, etc.

2) Daisy Chain

Professional digital signage monitors have built-in features to help you create Video Walls. They connect one screen to the other through DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort. This process is called daisy chaining. In addition, each display is configured according to its position on the Video Wall. All you need is to connect your Player to the first monitor and all TV's will show the corresponding "tiled image" based on your Video Wall configuration

3) Graphic Boards
-----------------

Maybe the easiest way to build a Video Wall is by simply adding multiple video cards into your Windows computer used as a Player. This can be achieved with regular video cards, or in case you want several screens, we recommend using a professional graphic card, so that you can easily add 12 or more screens to a single Windows machine!

[Install and configure your Windows desktop](https://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-set-up-multiple-monitors-with-windows-7.html), so that the displays are arranged according to your Video Wall needs. Now, all you need to do is run the OnSign TV Windows Player App. Right-click on the App and select “Toggle Full Screen”. The Player will play the video across all configured screens.
