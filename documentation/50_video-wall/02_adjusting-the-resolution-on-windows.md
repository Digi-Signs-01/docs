Adjusting the resolution on Windows
===================================

Set up the resolution of the OnSign TV  Player App on Windows to fit your screen or occupy a portion of the desktop.

On very recent OnSign TV Player App for Windows versions, the resolution can be set directly in the Player Settings. For previous versions, please see the instructions in the second part.

These instructions apply to the OnSign TV  Player App for Windows 10.3.2 and above.

1. Go to your Player in your OnSign TV account and select the Settings menu.
2. Scroll almost to the bottom where you find the Window Configuration and toggle it on.

3. Choose between Window, Borderless Window, Fullscreen, Multiwindow Fullscreen, or Force a specific Window Position.
   1. Window: The OnSign TV Player App will open in a regular window.
   2. Borderless Window: Hide all frames and borders from the OnSign TV Player App.
   3. Fullscreen: The OnSign TV Player App will take up the whole display.
   4. Multiwindow Fullscreen: This setting extends the App to all monitors, provided there is no issue with the drivers.
   5. Force Window Position: Can be used with Window or Borderless Window setting. Define exactly which portion of the display the OnSign TV Player App should take up. Choose  X Offset, Y Offset, Width, and Height.
4. Save the Changes.

These instructions apply to the OnSign TV  Player App for Windows 6.0.2 and above.

When operating Windows Media Players to control Video Wall setups you can force the OnSign TV  Player App to extend over a certain part of the displays. Adjust the resolution quickly by following the instructions below upon downloading the OnSign TV Player Software:

1. Open the OnSign TV  Player App on your device Player.
2. Right-click over the App. It doesn't matter whether you already entered the authentication code in your OnSign TV account and is already displaying content or whether you still have to undertake this step.
3. Click on "Settings".
4. The pop-up window shows a few options. Confer the description below:
   1. **Fullscreen:** If you make use of professional graphic boards, OnSign TV will automatically detect a virtual desktop which can include multiple monitors. Otherwise, the OnSign TV  Player App will only be displayed on the primary display.
   2. **Extended Screen - Multi monitor:** The OnSign TV  Player App will request how many displays are connected to the device Player and what their resolution is. Once this info is provided, the App will extend over the displays. This should extend the App to all monitors without fail, provided there is no issue with the drivers.
   3. **Frameless:** Hide all frames & borders from the OnSign TV  Player App.
   4. **Force Geometry:** Set up exactly which portion of the display the OnSign TV  Player App should take up. This is the safest option as it does not rely on the driver. Just make sure to test exactly the size of the display by hitting "Move". In older versions of the OnSign TV Player Software, this can be done by [following the steps shown in this tutorial](/video-wall/setting-the-resolution-with-geometry).
5. Confirm with "Save".
