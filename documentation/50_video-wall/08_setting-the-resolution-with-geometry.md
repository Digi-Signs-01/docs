Setting the resolution with Geometry
====================================

Use the "Geometry" command to expand the Player App over the whole screen each time you open it.

This function is also useful when you use a computer as a Player and want to display it to the extended screen. Instead of manually adjusting the App window each time you open OnSign TV, follow the instructions below and save time:

1. Open the OnSign TV  Player App on your device.
2. Right-click on the App’s background and select "Player Settings", then mark “Frameless" mode.

3. Close the window and then right-click the App icon on the desktop. Select “Properties”.
4. In the "Target" field, add --geometry=X,Y,L,H to the end of the text:

5. The first two sets of numbers (X,Y) indicate where the top-left corner of the App begins, and the following two (L,H) define the desired resolution for the second screen or App. Confer the example below where one screen is used to access the OnSign TV [website](https://onsign.tv/) and manage Content, while the larger one is used as the Player:

6. Confirm with “Ok”.

Now each time you open the App, it should display the exact location you set to occupy the predefined resolution.
