Searching Campaigns by Tag
==========================

Did you stay organized and tagged all Content you created? Now, all this effort will pay off!

Find that piece of Content you forgot the name of by [using Tags](/create-your-first-campaign/organizing-campaigns-with-tags). Needless to say that you must have filled the tag field beforehand! Find a tagged piece of Content in no time by following the instructions below:

1. Log into your OnSign TV account. There is a search field directly on the Content page at the top-right.

2. As you place the cursor on the box, a drop-down menu will appear. Click on the search option "Tags".

3. All tags you have ever created will be listed on that menu. Find the desired tag and click it.

If you want to avoid scrolling down a tag list, simply type “tag:” followed by the word you are looking for and click Enter.

4. All tagged Content with the specific term will appear as a result!
