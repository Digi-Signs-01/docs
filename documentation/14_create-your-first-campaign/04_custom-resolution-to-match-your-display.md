Custom resolution to match your display
=======================================

Are you displaying digital signage on an UltraWide monitor, Video Wall, or any other non-standard proportion device? Then, custom resolution is what you need.

This option is part of the custom layout settings in your **Campaign Editor**. If you don’t know yet how to create different screen layouts, adding screen divisions, and changing from landscape to portrait mode, [check out this tutorial](/create-your-first-campaign/how-to-create-custom-screen-layouts).

In this tutorial we are going to learn how to set a custom resolution:

1. In your OnSign TV [account](https://app.onsign.tv/content/), edit an existing Campaign or create a new one. Click on “Add Custom Layout” in the header of the Screen Layout section.

2. Define the Device Orientation and then click on “Device Resolution”. Select “Custom”, the last item from the list.

3. Type in the desired resolution. In this tutorial, we match the resolution to the size of a two monitor Video Wall placed side by side in landscape mode. The first screen is 1920 x 1080 and the second is 1366 x 768. We need to add the widths together and take the taller one's height. This will give us our result: 3268 x 1080.

4. Enter the divisions in the new layout and confirm with "Create Layout".
5. Now, you can start adding Content to your Campaign with Custom Layout!

TIP: Keep in mind that depending on your Video Wall configuration, the image might get distorted. Always add content which matches the screen resolution, like this one:
