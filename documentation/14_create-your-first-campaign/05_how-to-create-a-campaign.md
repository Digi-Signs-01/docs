How to create a Campaign
========================

A Campaign is how we call the feature where you insert content items into different screen regions.

As you create and publish them, they will be downloaded and displayed onto your Playerâ€™s screen. It groups media files such as images, videos, gifs, and Apps like clocks and weather forecasts together.

1. In your OnSign TV account, go to your "Content" page
2. Then click the "New" button on the top of the page, and select "Campaign" from the drop-down menu.

3. You'll be redirected to the Campaign editor page. The tools for setting up a Campaign are the Campaign Info area, [Screen Layout](/create-your-first-campaign/how-to-create-custom-screen-layouts), [Timeline](/create-your-first-campaign/how-to-use-the-timeline) (where you insert the media you want to display in each of the different screen regions and in a specific order), and the Content area at the bottom which mirrors your Content structure.
