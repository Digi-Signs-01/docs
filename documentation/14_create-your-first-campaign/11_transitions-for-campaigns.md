Transitions for Campaigns
=========================

Adding transitions can greatly improve the impact of your content. It makes it more pleasant and fluid. OnSign TV supports transitions between Campaigns, Timeline items, and also Playlist items.

The support to transitions will depend on the hardware and player settings as follows:

* **Android Players** – Android Players have full support to transitions. The exception to this rule is when the player is configured for using the “Safe mode video playback”, this will disable transition for videos. If using the “Legacy HTML5 webview” this may stop transitions from working for html based content.
* **Windows Players** – Full support to transitions
* **Linux Players** – Full support to transitions
* **SSP 2, 3 and 4** – No support to transitions
* **SSP5 and 6** – Support transitions on all content except videos
* **LG WebOS** - Full suport to transitons on webOS 4+
* **BrightSign XD/XT/XC devices** - Full support to transitions
* **BrightSign LS/HD** - No support to transitions
* **ChromeOS** - Full support to transitions

### Important Notes

Transitions and animations **WILL NOT** work if:

* "Use HTML Webview legacy" is enabled in the Player Settings (Android only).
* "Safe mode for video playback" is enabled in the Player Settings (Android only).
* Using an old device with a not powerful enough CPU. To ensure your hardware runs smoothly and stable, we highly recommend testing the usage of transitions on a sample device for at least 24hrs before publishing it to a large number of Players.
* If "Disable Transitions" is marked in the Player Settings. You can also take advantage of this feature to disable transitions on specific Players you don't want transitions to run on.
