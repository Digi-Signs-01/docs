Restricting a Layout division
=============================

In a large operation with a large userbase, individual users may be tasked with only very narrow range of allowed actions. Let's take this scenario: you have several users working on a Campaign, but each user only works on the content of one particular screen division and nothing else. Follow these steps to limit their actions to only their particular screen division.

Because there is no dedicated permission system to limit Timelines for individual users, we work with Playlists.

### Setup requirements

* 1 Campaign with a divided layout, already published to a Player
* 2 Playlists, one in each Timeline
* 2 restricted users

We base everything off a Campaign which has a divided layout. In the Timelines of the Campaign we place two Playlists, one in each Timeline. These Playlists hold the content of the each of the layout divisions.

The Campaign is published to a Player.

We will need two or more restricted users. If you have no additional users besides yourself on your account yet, [read here](/user-accounts-and-permissions/creating-additional-users) how to set up new users and what a restricted user is.

1. Insert each Playlist in the corresponding Timeline of the Campaign.

2. Give modifying permission for each of the Playlists to the restricted user who should work on it. Refer to [this tutorial](/user-accounts-and-permissions/setting-permissions-to-users) for a a detailed explanation about permissions.

Each user can now edit only their part of the screen.

Note: Naturally, the two Playlists will not have the exact same duration. Set the shorter timeline to loop.
