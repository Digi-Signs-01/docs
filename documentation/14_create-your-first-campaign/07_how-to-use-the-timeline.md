How to use the Timeline
=======================

The Timeline is your digital signage stage in a Campaign! Master this tool in a few seconds

Access your Content page and click on the button “New" followed by choosing "Campaign”. The Timeline is right under the Screen Layout and is the central point of your Campaign, showing how many media items and apps you are broadcasting simultaneously, for how long and how. Learn the main uses of this tool.

### Determine the duration of a Campaign

Right above the ruler you can set how many seconds the Campaign as a whole should last. Set the seconds in "Manual Duration".

Alternatively, you can select "Automatic Duration", making the Timeline length expand every time you add a new item to it.

### Complete a media sequence

Your Content from your main Content page is mirrored right beneath the Timeline. Drag and drop items from it to your Timeline, so they can be viewed by your audience.

### Adjust media and app durations

In the Timeline, hold onto the bar at the end of each item and drag it to shorten or lengthen, similar to how you adjust column sizes in an Excel spreadsheet. You can also click on the item to open a dialog window with duration and other settings, such as a [Ken Burns effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns_effect) for photos and editing for apps.

### Insert audio track

Toggle the radio button next to the audio icon to green in order to create a new line of the Timeline where you can insert music and other audio for as long as your Campaign lasts.

### Mute audio tracks

If you bring videos into the Timeline, disable their sound, especially if you have an overlap from another layer of sound by clicking on the speaker icon besides each line and with this muting it.

### Lock layer

If you are done with adding content into one line, lock it before editing the following one to not edit it any further by mistake. This is for your convenience only, it is not a requirement for Campaign editing. It also prevents Shared Accounts who have access to this Campaign from editing it.
