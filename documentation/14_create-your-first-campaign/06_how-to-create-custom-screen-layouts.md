How to create Custom Screen Layouts
===================================

Imagine, for instance, Screen Layouts split into three blocks: one of them is an image slideshow, while the other two informs of local time and weather. Setting different zones on your Campaign is quite easy.

1. Start by [creating a Campaign](/create-your-first-campaign/how-to-create-a-campaign).
2. After giving the Campaign a descriptive name, take a look at the Screen Layout box. By default, the layout shown for your first Campaign will have three different screen regions. You can choose other types of layouts, vertical or horizontal, or with more or less regions.

3. If you want a different Layout than what is readily available, click on the blue "Add Custom Layout" button on the right.
4. A pop-up window will open, simulating your digital signage screen.
5. You create your own Layout by clicking on "Add Division" underneath the Layout Preview and dragging the shapes to the desired size. You can also adjust the sizes with the Screen Divisions table on the left.
6. You can give the Custom Layout a name to easier recognize it, but it is optional. Are your Screen Layouts how you need them to be? Hit “Create Layout”! The Custom Layout window will close, bringing you back to the Campaign Editor.

Your new Layout will be selected. Note that with the selection of a new Layout, the Timeline will adapt to it. If you had a two-screen-division Layout and selected a new three-screen-division Layout, a new line will be added to the Timeline box.
