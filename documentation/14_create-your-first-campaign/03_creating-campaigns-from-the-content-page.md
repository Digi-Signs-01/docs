Creating Campaigns from the Content page
========================================

There is another path for creating a Campaign besides beginning with a blank Campaign. You can first select the media and later refine your Campaign. Check it out:

1. In your OnSign TV account, go to your Content page.
2. To make it practical, organize the Content you want to use in a Folder.
3. With the mouse, select all media items you want to include in the Campaign.
4. Right-click over the selected items and hit the “New Campaign” option from the pop-up menu.

5. Set a title for the Campaign and the duration of each image file. Click “Create Campaign” when you are finished.

6. You’ll be redirected to the Campaign editor page. Now, you can edit other preferences, such as [Screen Layout](/create-your-first-campaign/how-to-create-custom-screen-layouts), adjust each file's length, [add Apps](/apps/creating-an-app), and more.
