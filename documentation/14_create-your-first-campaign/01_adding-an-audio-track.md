Adding an Audio track
=====================

Add mp3 files or an [Audio Announcement](/audio-content/using-audio-announcement-app) into your Timeline and let your Campaign speak to your audience's ears.

1. In your OnSign TV account, [create a new Campaign](/create-your-first-campaign/how-to-create-a-campaign) or edit an existing one from your Campaign Folder.
2. If you haven't uploaded an .mp3 file yet, do so now. In your Campaign Content library at the bottom of the page, click on the orange “New” button and "Upload File". Select an .mp3 file from your Computer. You can also drag and drop the file right into the Content library.
3. After uploading the file, enable the “Audio Track” in the Timeline header.

4. Drag the just uploaded audio file from the Content library to the newly appearing Timeline track.  
   Do not forget to mute other tracks to avoid overlapping audio, specially if you used a video file in your Campaign.

5. Click on “Save" and "Publish” before leaving the page. Preferably test the result in a single Player before deploying it to the whole signage system.
