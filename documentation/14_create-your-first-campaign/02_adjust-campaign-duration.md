Adjust Campaign duration
========================

By default, the duration of a Campaign is set to 30 seconds, but you can easily make the Campaign length shorter or longer depending on your needs.

1. Create a [new Campaign](/create-your-first-campaign/how-to-create-a-campaign) or edit an existing one. Scroll down to the Timeline section.
2. Update the Timeline length with one of the following methods:

### Manual Duration

Change the number next to the clock icon in the Timeline header. Note that the duration is written in seconds. If you want a three minute Campaign, you need to type in 180. Once you hit enter, the Timeline length will match the Campaign duration.

### Automatic Duration

When this option is selected, adding new items to the Timeline will expand it automatically. As you remove files, it will shrink as well. Meaning, the Timeline will always have the same length as your Content.

### Variable Duration

When the duration set to variable, one Timeline has to be the main Timeline which the other Timelines oriented to.

Click the icon on the left side of the Timeline to set the main Timeline.
