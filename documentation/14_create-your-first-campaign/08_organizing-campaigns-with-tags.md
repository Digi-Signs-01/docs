Organizing Campaigns with Tags
==============================

Organize your Campaigns with Tags: classify them according to region, content, target audience, or anything you want!

Besides Categories, you can add Tags to pretty much every Content on your OnSign TV account, making it easier to be found. If you are drowning in Content no doubt Tags are a helping hand! Besides [search](/create-your-first-campaign/searching-campaigns-by-tag), you can also [publish more quickly](/basics-publishing/publish-tag-filtered-content) than ever!

Tag Campaigns
-------------

1. From the Content page of your OnSign TV [account](https://app.onsign.tv/content/), [create or edit a Campaign](/create-your-first-campaign/how-to-create-a-campaign).
2. The Tags box is found right next to the Campaign's Category. Just type in the text you want. You can add as many tags as you want by placing a comma between different Tags (,) or using the tab key. The platform will suggest Tags you have used before as you type Tags.

You can tag other Content, like [Playlists](/players/organizing-players-with-tags), Apps, Compositions, Data Feeds, and also [Players](/players/organizing-players-with-tags).
