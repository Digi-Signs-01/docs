Signing Out from Digisigns App
===========================

Signing out a device is a simple procedure for disconnecting a hardware device associated with a Screen name.

After detaching, the Screen name will keep on being listed so that a new device can be later be paired with it.

Steps for signing out from a hardware device:

1. Go to the Screen you want to sign out from.
2. Click on this Screens's Vertical Ellipsis (â‹®).
3. In the settings, you will find the Sign Out button.

5. Confirm to Sign Out.

6. No device will be shown in the Screen information anymore. In the Screens overview, the screen will be shown as Unassigned. The App will revert to displaying a code like it did during the Connect App stage.

**Note:** A Signed Out Screen still consumes a Screen license, unless you check the archive screen option for this screen.
