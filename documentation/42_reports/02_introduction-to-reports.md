Introduction to reports
=======================

OnSign TV Reports are a powerful tool which allows you to track and analyze how your Content is being played back. You can filter, aggregate, and present your data in a variety of ways to get the insights you need.

Reports can be created for Content played back up to 60 days in the past. To create a new Report, click on the Reports tab in the sidebar on the left and then click on the "+ New Report" button.

You can choose to create a **Single Report** or a **Scheduled Report**. Single Reports are generated immediately, while scheduled Reports can be configured to run on a recurring basis.

Due to the large amount of data which may be involved, Reports are created in the background and can take several minutes or even hours to complete, depending on the number of Players and the amount of data being processed.

Once a Report is ready, you will receive an email notification and the Report will be available on the Reports screen.

Once a Report is listed, its content can be downloaded by clicking on the download button, or clicking on the duplicate icon ![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731682608336/b5277148-6b86-47ef-aa7d-8764b8aacc0a.png) to edit the report options and recreated it.

Created Reports are listed on the Reports screen and are also stored in a folder called Saved Reports. Saved Reports are kept forever unless you manually delete them.
