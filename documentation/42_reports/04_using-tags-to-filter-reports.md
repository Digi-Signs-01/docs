Using Tags to filter Reports
============================

Tags can be applied to Players and to Content. Tags offer huge flexibility for creating handy playback rules and can also be used to filter which Content will be used in a Playback Report.

Tags can be used to filter which Players will be included in the Report:

Make sure to select the filtering option that best addresses your needs:

* **Has All Tags** - Meaning the item needs to have all listed Tags to be included in the Report
* **Has Any Tags** - Meaning the item needs to have at least one Tag of the list to be included in the Report.
