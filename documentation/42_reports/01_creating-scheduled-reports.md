Creating scheduled Reports
==========================

Automate Reports to conveniently keep track of your Content playback.

You can **schedule Reports** to be generated automatically. Set rules to get playback data periodically and even send them automatically by email to other shared users and clients.

1. In your OnSign TV account, select “Reports” on the side menu.
2. You can either get a single Report instantly or schedule Reports to be created when you want them to. If you wish to generate a single Report, you are already on the right page. Simply click on the top-right and select “New Report”.  
   If you want to schedule a Report, change to the tab on top which says “Scheduled Reports” and then click on the top-right to create a "New Report".

3. When you only need one **Single Report**, you decide for which period of time you need it.

1. However, if you need Reports on a weekly or monthly basis, scheduling makes your life easier. Select the option “**Scheduled Report**” and fill out the details. At first, we mainly focus on the section “Report Period”.

* Give the Report a "**Name**".

* Click “**Add Rule**” if you wish to generate Reports with the same parameters on a regular frequency.

* Click “**Add Date**” to generate a single scheduled Report on a specific date.

* Select the **Report Period** covered by the Report. You can gather Content playback data of previous days, weeks, or even up to 2 months.
* Optionally fill out the **Period Offset** in case you want the Report to end prior to the day when it is going to be generated. Let's explain this.  
  **Example:** You generate the Report on the 5th of each month, but you want to cover only the previous month as a whole. Set 5 as the Offset so the beginning of the current month won’t be included in this Report.

5. Next, we fill out the preferences for the Report itself. No matter if you are getting a single report or a scheduled one, the following steps are the same:

* Select the **Players** from which you wish to collect the data. In case you wish to track Content from your entire signage network, leave it blank.
* Select the **Content** whose playback you wish to analyze. Leave this blank as well if you want to get an overview of every Content combined.

6. At "Report Kind", select how the Content playback info should be presented in the Report. Check out the description beside each option:

7. At last, at "Report Options" you define the **Output Format** (HTML, PDF, Excel spreadsheet, or Excel CSV). Very large reports can't be generated in PDF format. In such a case, it is better to use CSV, spreadsheet, or HTML.

8. Determine who will receive **Notification by Email** to download the file. There are some more options you can fill out to customize the Report.

The email doesn’t need to be associated with your OnSign TV account. Set as many notification emails as you wish.

9. Finish by clicking “Create Report” at the bottom.

10) View all Scheduled Reports in the tab "Scheduled Reports". Once the first Report is generated, the button "View Reports" will replace the button "Scheduled" on the side (see image below). As you click, you will be redirected to the Reports.

You can also check out all Report files by going to the "Content" page and selecting the "Saved Reports" Folder.
