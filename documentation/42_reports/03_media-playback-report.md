Media playback Report
=====================

Besides tracking Content Playback, OnSign TV also makes it possible to track individual playback of every media presented by every Player.

AVAILABLE ONLY TO SELECT PLANS!

To take advantage of Media Playback Reporting, it is necessary to:

* Enable Playback Reporting for the specific media to be tracked.
* Enable Media Reporting on every Player which will be tracked.

### Important note:

Media playback tracking will only start after the above settings have been configured. No playback events are recorded before these settings are active.

Step 1 - Enable Player Media Playback Tracking
----------------------------------------------

1. Go to the "**Players**" tab.
2. **Select the Player** you want to get the report for.
3. Select "**Settings**" from the menu on the left.
4. **Enable "Media reporting"**. If you want to generate media reports across your network, then adjust this in the [Player Default Settings](/player-settings/configuring-multiple-players), instead of in an individual Players's Settings.

5. Click on "**Save Changes**".

Step 2 - Select Media to be Tracked
-----------------------------------

1. Go to the "**Content**" tab.
2. **Right-click on the media** you want to get the report for. You can also select multiple files.
3. Choose "**Enable reporting**".

4. Click "**Enable**" in the dialog window.

An orange check icon will be shown on the thumbnail of the media file indicate that Media Reporting is enabled. As Media Reporting uses a lot of data, you don't want to overdo it. To disable Media Reporting just right-click on the file and "Disable Media Reporting".

### Step 3 - Create Media Playback Reports

Playback Reports will automatically include Media Playback once you have enabled the "**Players to record the playback of media files**" (Step 1) and **marked which media to be tracked** (Step 2).

Just follow the same process to create reports:

1. Click on the "Reports" tab.
2. Click on "New report" in the top-right corner.
3. Complete the required fields for filtering the Report as desired.
4. Set a beginning and end date for your Report. You can create single or [recurring Reports](/reports/creating-scheduled-reports).
5. Select which Players the Report should be about.
6. If nothing is set in the Content Box, the report will include all Campaigns, Playlists, and Media playback. Alternatively, you can have one or more specific assets to be reported.
7. Once all filters and fields are configured, click on the "Create Report" button.

Reporting is an intensive task, as we must dive into all Players' events. For this reason, Reports are created in the background and can take a while to be finished.

Once a Report is started, you can load other pages as there is no need to wait for it to be completed. To avoid keeping you waiting, we recommend entering your email in the notification field, so the OnSign TV platform will send you a message once the Report is ready to be downloaded.
