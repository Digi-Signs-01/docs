Applying transparent background
===============================

Each OnSign TV  Player App is customazible on different levels. Some of them offer, besides color options, the opacity bar. Set the App’s background to transparent or less opaque in order to show content from the layer underneath.

1. In your OnSign TV account, go to the “Content” page. You can create a new App by clicking on "New" > "App", or edit an existing one.
2. The vast majority of Apps have the opacity bar enabled.
3. Click on the “Background color” box. Select a color and move the arrow on the opacity bar with the checkered design to adjust transparency. Scroll it all the way to the left to make it completely transparent.

   You can also adjust transparency to other App elements. For Clock Apps this may include font and dials:

   Moving the opacity bar is always an option. Some Apps make it even more convenient for you where all you need to do is to check the “Transparent Background” box as is the case for example with the QR Code App.

4. Hit “Preview”. Further modify the color if needed, and confirm with “Save”.
5. Your App has been stored to your Content Library and is ready to be used. Simply drag it onto your Campaign's Timeline. Remember setting the App to an overlapping layer so the content behind it is fully visible, resulting in a seemless effect in your Campaign.
