Creating additional users
=========================

You can create additional user accounts for other users to help you manage your digital signage operation on OnSign TV. Create as many user accounts as you want:

1. Click on your username in the bottom-left of your OnSign TV account and then select “Settings” from the drop-down menu.

4. Fill out all the blanks, which include full name, email, and password. You also have to define the account type:

**Administrator**

This kind of user can see the website exactly as you can. They can see all of the content and Players, as well as modify and even delete them. This user may also change plans and payment information, or create and modify users if you allow them by checking the options (see image below).

**Organization Owner**

In the past, it was only possible to have one organization owner account, and the organization owner was the only one who could create additional administrator users and delete the whole account. Now, you can have an unlimited amount of organization owners. However, be careful as this user can do anything you can do, including delete the main account.

**Restricted User**

This user can only view what you allow. If you want them to edit existing content, read the [How-to-set-permissions](/user-accounts-and-permissions/setting-permissions-to-users) tutorial.

5. Click “Save”.

6. The account has been successfully created. Send the initial password to access OnSign TV to the person you created the account for. It can be changed after they log into their OnSign TV user account.
