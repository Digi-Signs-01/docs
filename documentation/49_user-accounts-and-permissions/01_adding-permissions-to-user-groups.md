Adding permissions to user groups
=================================

Give access to Content and Players to multiple restricted users in one click.

If as a OnSign TV admin, you created new Content or Players and wish to grant multiple restricted users access to it, simply add permission to a user group. This works the same way as giving permissions to individual accounts.

1. Click on your username on the bottom-left corner on your OnSign TV dashboard and select “Settings”.
2. Click on “Users” at the bottom of the sidebar menu and subsequently on "Groups" in the header.
3. Find the group you want to modify permissions for and hit the “Edit” icon on the right.

4. Then, select from the sidebar menu whether you want to share Content or Players.

5. Go to "Content Permissions". A newly created group will have no folders or content shared with it. Click on the orange "Add Content" button on the top-right corner.

6. In the pop-up window, you can select the Folders and Content you want to share and click on the red "Confirm" button at the bottom-right of the window.

7. You will be shown another pop-up where you can determine which actions the group is allowed to perform on these new items by turning the switches on or off. When you confirmed the "Change", you are sent back to an overview of all Content shared with the group and you can check your settings once more or adjust them.

8. The process is the same for granting Player or Player Group permissions. Select "Player Permissions" or "Player Group Permissions" from the sidebar. Add the Players or Player Groups you want to "Grant Permissions".

9. Then select the degree of permission for each Player or Player Group by turning the switches on or off.

At any time you wish to share new Content or Players with a certain user group, you can edit the user group permissions. Another path is adding the group to the item permissions on the Content or Player page.
