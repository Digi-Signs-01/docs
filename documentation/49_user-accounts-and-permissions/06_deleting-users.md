Deleting users
==============

You can delete a user account anytime. All content the user previously created or changed will remain on your OnSign TV platform.

For instance, if the user created and published a Campaign to 'Player A', it will keep playing even after the user account is deleted.

1. In your OnSign TV account, click on your username in the bottom-left, and then go to “Settings”.
2. Select “Users” from the sidebar menu.
3. Check the user you want to delete from your Users list. Then click on the red "Remove” button on the top-right.
