Using Clock Apps
================

Clock Apps are quite useful, specially in public transportation, in companies and universities. Basically anywhere where people need to be on time. Check out how to display time and date info on your signage below:

1. Go to the Content tab on your OnSign TV workspace. Click the "New" button on the top-left, followed by "App".
2. A pop-up window will appear on your screen with all available OnSign TV Content Apps. The Clock category due to alphabetic order is one of the top categories in the sidebar menu. Select the design you like most. Below is an overview of some available Clock Apps:

Simple Clocks
-------------

* Analog Round Clock
* Analog Square Clock
* Digital Clock Simple
* Holiday Clock
* Glow Clock
* Round Clock Modern
* Clock Bar Modern
* LCD Clock

These Simple Clocks Apps can be easily set to a small screen zone, letting the focus remain on the main content. Clocks are available in round and square layout. If you want something more modern looking, we offer digital style clocks. There is also a holiday themed clock for Christmas time.

Event Countdown, Countdown, Time Elapsed and Timers
---------------------------------------------------

Begin the anticipation to holidays or special events with the Event Countdown App and Countdown App. The Time Elapsed App, on the other hand, keeps track of how much time has passed since an event occurred – such as an accident or the last time a client had a complaint. There is even a Timer App you can set to count down or up.

2. As you select a Clock App to complement your Campaign, you will be requested to configure it. Besides the basic information, like app name and locations, you are able to personalize colors, dial numeric systems, and backgrounds. The settings vary for each clock – while some are fully customizable, others will only allow for a few color changes.

3. Click on "Preview” to check how your settings look.

4. If you like the result, hit “Save”. The App is now in your Content Library and ready to be used.
