Using QR Codes
==============

Display more Content than fits on one screen right onto your audience's mobile device.

A QR code is a two dimensional image which stores information in black and white pixels. It is quickly scanned by cell phones and represents much more data than standard barcodes. You can share text, images, videos, and URLs on your audience's cell phone displays.

This is how to set up the OnSign TV **QR Code App**:

1. Go to your Content page, click the orange New button, and then select App.
2. Pick the “**Text and Scrollers**” tab from the sidebar menu of the pop-up window.

3. Choose the “QR Code” App and fill out the following info:

   * **App name:** Simply name the App anything you like. By this name you find the App among your OnSign TV Content.
   * **Text to be encoded to QRCode:** Type the Content you want to trigger on the cell phone. It can be either a text or a URL to a web page, image, or video.
   * **QRCode color, Background color, Background image:** Set color for and around the QR code. You can also go with a transparent background by checking the "Transparent Background" box below.
4. Leave the editor by clicking "Save".

Now, you just need to insert this new App from your Content catalog in your Campaigns, Playlists, or Compositions.
