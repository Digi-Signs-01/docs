Using Weather Apps
==================

Weather is the go-to small talk topic. As such, the popularity of Weather Apps never fades! The OnSign TV platform offers multiple Weather Apps to keep your audience aware of today's temperature and of the next few days. This is how you add this info to your Content:

1. On your Content page, click on "New" > "App".
2. Choose "Weather" from the menu of the App Library and choose one of the available Weather Apps. There are many options to choose from. Below is a quick overview of some of the options:

Small Screen Zones
------------------

These Apps are ideal for placement in corners of the screen, leaving most of the screen space available for other content.

* The Simple Weather App shows just the current temperature and weather condition.
* The Small Weather App (*on the left*) displays a three day forecast in slideshow mode.
* The Modern Weather Forecast App (*on the right*) highlights the current temperature and the next three days of forecast in a row below.
* The Weather App shows the current temperature high and lows, as well as precipitation, wind speed, and humidity, in a sleek and animated design.

Tall and Bar
------------

This style of Weather Apps is meant to be placed in a thin but long area on the screen, either horizontal (bar) or vertical (tall). If you want to use this style, choose the Weather Forecast Tall and Bar (*left*) or Modern Weather Forecast Tall and Bar (*right*).

Full Size

This style is better visible on the whole screen. The classic Weather Forecast (*left*) shows current conditions and a three-day forecast. There are also layouts available for Multi Day or Multi City (*right: Multi City Weather Widget*) forecasts.

For atmosphere, Themable Weather Forecast adds themes to the background based on current weather conditions.
