Using PowerBI App
=================

OnSign TV can be used to present PowerBI dashboards and reports directly on your signage screens. Better yet, access to the PowerBI platform is directly authenticated through your Microsoft account, so your password is not stored on OnSign TV.

This App is **NOT** compatible with:

* Samsung SoC â€“ SSSP2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
* LG webOS 3 and 4
* BrightSign LS3 and below; BrightSign XD4 and below.

Follow these steps to configure and present PowerBI content:

1. Authenticate OnSign TV on your Microsoft Account:
   * In your OnSign TV account, go to Settings > Integration Accounts
   * Click the orange button "**+ Add Account**" on the top-right
   * Select **Add Microsoft Account**
   * Authorize OnSign TV to access your Microsoft PowerBI Account

   * Click the orange "**+New**" button
