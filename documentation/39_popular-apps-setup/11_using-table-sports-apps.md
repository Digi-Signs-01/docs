Using Table & Sports Apps
=========================

OnSign TV provides different Apps in table format. Get to know the different types below and how to create them:

1. To view all available Table & Sports App templates, go to the App Library of your OnSign TV platform ([Creating an App](/apps/creating-an-app)).
2. Select a category from the sidebar menu of the pop-up window. You find Directory Lists in "Menu Boards & Tables" or Match Score and League Tables in "Sports".

Directory List
--------------

The Directory List App is part of the "Menu Boards & Tables" section. It allows you to organize information in rows and columns. Great for designing timetables and showing data.

1. Give the App a name  and the table a title. The title will be displayed on top of your signage content on the screen, while the name is for your own reference when searching for the App in your account.
2. Select between a few pre-made layout options. Choose a font, text size, colors, or add a new background image and a logo.
3. Write the text you want to display in the text editor. Each new line will create a new row. Commas separate columns.

**Note:** The column height does not change. Write up to five lines. If you need more lines, create another Directory List App and continue on the line where you stopped. The number of columns is unlimited, but be mindful of your screen size to avoid the text looking cluttered, specially if you use long words or sentences per column.

Match Scores Widget
-------------------

The Match Scores Widget App is part of the "Sports" section. Because sports have a strong appeal, we separated sport themed tables from other text tables. With Match Scores Widget you can list up to four scores of highlight sport matches per table! Ideal for soccer, handball, and basketball, for instance.

1. Similar to the Directory List, commas separate the scores of each match. Write “Avalon, 1, Camelot, 0” and the score will automatically be set in the table as “Avalon 1 - 0 Camelot”.
2. There are preset backgrounds of popular sports, but feel free to add your own image.

There is also a Data Feed enabled version of this App.

If you are only interested in the one and only global sport, "Soccer Scores", see down below, is an even more convenient way to showcase soccer results. It shows the results of the complete match day of the world's most popular leagues.

Soccer League Table
-------------------

The Soccer League Table App is part of the "Sports" section. Let your audience know of their teams' latest standings in a league. Group up to five teams together and show how many matches they have won or lost, among other information.

1. Choose an App name, and also give the table a title and subtitle.
2. Write the group name.
3. Now, you can highlight info of up to 5 different teams. Write it in the following sequence, separated by commas: position,team,matches played,wins,draws,losses,goals for,goals against,goals difference,points.

Remember to use this exact formatting: don’t insert any space between commas and the data, or else nothing will appear on the App as you save it.

There is also a Data Feed enabled version of this App.

Soccer Table & Soccer Scores
----------------------------

The Soccer Table and Soccer Scores Apps are part of the "Sports" section. For the most popular soccer leagues "Soccer Tables" and "Soccer Score" show the standings of selected leagues automatically without any additional data input from your side after setup.

1. Name the app.
2. Select a League.

3. Select a Round.  
   ![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731650715445/using-table-apps_7.jpg)
4. Adjust layout settings, such as background color, font type, colors, and animations, etc.

Preview the outcome. If you are happy with how it looks and the data is set precisely, confirm with “Save”. The App will be placed in the App folder in your Content Library for future use.

FIFA World Cup
--------------

There are two dedicated Apps for the FIFA World Cup in soccer, a Scoreboard and a Standings App. The last World Cup was in 2022. The next World Cup will be in 2026 in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Expect an updated World Cup App version in due time.
