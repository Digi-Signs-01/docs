Using Meeting Room Apps
=======================

Manage communal company space better. With the Meeting Room Apps, you can display current meeting room availability and who has booked the room next. This way no one is going to use the room when it is already booked. Avoid confusion about room occupation by displaying which meeting is scheduled in the room and what it is about.

The Meeting Room App is available in two versions. The full screen version is called Meeting Room Calendar App. It is adaptable even to smaller screen regions. The narrow bar version is called Meeting Room Calendar Bar App. While the full screen version displays current as well as upcoming meetings, the bar only displays the room availability right now.

   * **Calendar/Room Name:** This is the main title displayed on screen.
   * **Calendar sync frequency:** Define the frequency in minutes by which the App shall look for new events and updates.
   * **Calendar timeout:** If your device goes offline, you can set a time in minutes after which the calendar will be shown as outdated. This is meant to inform people there might be updates, but they cannot be displayed on screen.
   * **Offline message:** While your calendar is offline you can set a message to advice of this fact and to maybe look at the company-wide calendar instead.
