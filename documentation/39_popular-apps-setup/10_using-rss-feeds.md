Using RSS Feeds
===============

Let the audience keep track of the latest news headlines with News Feed Apps. These Apps use RSS (Really Simple Syndication) technology to push fresh entries from your favorite websites right to your screen. Most News Apps also have a Data Feed enabled sibling.

Learn how use News Apps:

1. On the Content page of your OnSign TV account, create a new App by first clicking on the "New" button and then choosing "App" from the menu.
2. A pop-up window with the complete App Gallery will open. Select the “**News & RSS Feeds**” category from the menu.
3. Choose a News Feed App out of more than twelve available layouts.
4. When you have made your choice, fill out the settings.

All Apps require basic information, such as name, display duration of each post and the RSS URL. You find the RSS URL of your chosen website by for example looking them up on Google. Write the site name plus “RSS” and you will probably find what you need.

Most news websites offer different RSS segmented by categories (i.e. economy, local, entertainment, etc.). See the [New York Times’ RSS list](https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/index.html) for an example. Select a category and then copy the URL.

All other settings are related to the Apps' look, such as color, font, and size preferences. Each App has different degrees of customization.

5."Preview" the App.

6. Click on “Save” to add it to your App Library.

7. The App is now ready to be used as Content!

News & RSS Feeds Apps
---------------------

The full-screen News Apps look good when they occupy the whole screen or a large portion at the very least. There are several layouts available. Some Apps can be placed on the bottom or top of the screen, leaving more space for other Content. Some are Tickers where the news are shown in sequence with or without animation transitions. The other version scrolls the headline from right to left.

After select an App, remember to check below the image how this App is better viewed to match your screens orientation and layout:
