1. Go to the Content page of you OnSign TV account.
2. Click the “New" button, followed by choosing "App”.
3. A pop-up window will appear. You will find the Flight Status App under the category “Other”.
4. Fill out the information as follows:
   * **Name the App** and **choose an Airport** from the drop-down menu. The list is alphabetically. You can find the three letter code of any airport through the official [IATA website](https://www.iata.org/publications/Pages/code-search.aspx).
   * You also have the option to limit the display to only an Airline by inserting an **Airline code**.
   * **Display:** Choose Departures or Arrivals.
   * **Number of flights per screen:** Present at least 5 flights and up to 12 per screen.
   * **Show each page for (seconds):** Determine for how many seconds each page will be shown on the screen. Take into account the number of flights per screen so that your guests have enough time to read, as well as if you use Transition animations.
   * **Customize** the App to your preferences. You can modify font, colors, and background, add or remove Transition animations between pages, as well as set the language for the labels.
5. "Preview" the App. If you like the result, "Save" it to your account.

Your Flight Status App is ready to go on screen!
