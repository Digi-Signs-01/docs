Using Google Files
==================

Showcase Google Docs, Sheets, Forms, and Slides, keeping your signage content always updated.

For Docs, Sheets, and so forth, use the [Website Link App](/popular-apps-setup/using-website-link-app) to display content from any Google file directly on your screen. For Slides, there is also a dedicated App. Read about the Slides App further below.

By sharing your Google documents, you don’t need to think about updating content in your OnSign TV account. Every change is automatically updated by Google. This is additionally useful if there are staff members who update information, but do not necessarily need access to OnSign TV to manage your digital signage content.

Google Docs, Sheets etc.
------------------------

1. Open your Google Drive. For this tutorial, we have created a (Spread)Sheet with an Olympic Medals count.
2. Click on “File”, move over "Share", then click on “Publish to the web”.

3. On the pop-up window, select which part of the document you want to display. By default, Google will publish the entire document, but you can limit it. We are going to publish only the Medals by Country Sheet.

4. Confirm with "Publish". Keep the “Automatically republish when changes are made” option in the "Published content & settings" box marked.

5. Copy the URL and paste it into a new browser window to check the result before using it in OnSign TV.

6. Now, let's open your OnSign TV account. Click on the "New" button. Select “App” and choose the Web & Media category from the menu on the left. Pick the Website Link App.
7. Paste the URL from the Google document.

8. Save the App to use it as your Content.

We recommend testing the content on one device before deploying it to your entire digital signage network as the Website Link App is not visible in preview mode.

Google Slides
-------------

1. If you want to share Slides, open your Google Slides.
2. Click on “File”, move over "Share", then click on “Share with others”.

8. The Google Slides App can be previewed which is good practice to always do when setting up any Content.
9. Save the App to use as your Content.
