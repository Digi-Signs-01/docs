Using the Calendar App
======================

Do you want people to be up to date on events such as meetings and birthdays? Use a Calendar application to display daily, weekly, or monthly events.

2. Click on "New" and then on "App".
3. From the pop-up window's App selection, choose **Meeting Room & Calendar**.
4. Pick the “Calendar App” or the "Events Calendar App".

   * **Title:** This title will appear on the top-left corner of your App. You can label events like “Birthdays”, “Workshops”, “Meetings”, or “Conference”.
   * **Calendar URL (iCal):** Your events are synchronized from an iCal calendar. This file format is supported by a large number of providers, including Apple and Google. In this field, you need to provide your calendar's URL. Refer to this tutorial to learn [how to connect your calendar](/popular-apps-setup/connecting-your-calendar-server-ical).
   * **Display calendar events for:** Choose whether you want to display the events of a single day, a week, or a month.
   * Check the “**Show past events**” option to display events which have already ended. Keep in mind that if you select this option with a calendar with many continuous events, the events at the end of the day will get pushed down far to the end. We recommend using this option for daily displays, but to avoid it for weekly and monthly frequencies.
   * If you select “Month” or “Week”, mark “**Present events broken down in smaller periods**” to display events according to the days of the week (if you select to present weekly events) or by week (if you select to present monthly ones). If you don’t check this option, only the first five events will be displayed.
   * **Show time:** Select this option in the Calendar App to highlight events better.
   * **Number of events to be shown:** You can set it to up to 10 events if the "Show time" option is enabled or 16 without "Show time".
   * **Calendar sync frequency:** Define the frequency, in minutes, by which the App will look for updates in the calendar.
   * **Cycling time interval:** If you chose to display events from the entire week or month and have enabled the option to break down events into smaller periods, this is the field where you define how many seconds each week's or day's events are shown on screen.
   * **Calendar timeout:** In case your device goes offline and cannot access your calendar, you can set an expiration time. For instance, if you write here 60 minutes, the calendar won’t be displayed after 60 have passed anymore. Instead, a custom message will be shown to make people aware the calendar is unavailable (define the corresponding text in the Language tab).   
     This is a useful option if you have a flexible agenda in which new events come up any time or are cancelled often and you don't want your visitors to be surprised that the calendar is currently not up to date.
   * **Language tab:** Choose in which language and formats dates and other app innate text will be displayed or customize the labels to your needs.
6. Lastly, you need to set up the **look**, like images and colors. For the Calendar App, you can choose if you want an Entrance animation where events slide from right to left when the App comes up on screen. You can also remove the calendar icon on the left of the screen by unchecking “Show icon”.  
   Look at this example of a Calendar App with customized background but without icon and animation:

7. Preview the App and modify as needed. At last, click on “Save”.
