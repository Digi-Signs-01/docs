Creating a Zapier account
=========================

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/help/what-is-zapier/) is a web service which lets you integrate many of your web applications. It is one way to display your Instagram photos on your digital signage operation. You can create a free account via the following steps:

1. Go to [Zapier website](https://zapier.com/).
2. Click on "Sign up" on the top-right. Write email address and name. Then confirm with "Get started free".

3. The next page will offer app recommendations. You can select apps you frequently use or just click “Continue”.
4. Your account is ready to use!

After a 14 day trial period with all features available, your account will be switched to the free plan. As OnSign TV does not require any special feature for displaying Instagram photos, there is no need of subscribing to any other plan.
