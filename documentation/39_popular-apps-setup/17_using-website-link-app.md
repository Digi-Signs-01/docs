Using Website Link App
======================

With the Website Link App you can quickly present a web page and configure it to either block or allow users to interact with it on screen.

Here are the steps to configure the Website Link App:

1. Go to the “Content” page and click on "New" at the top of the page. Then choose "App".
2. Select **Web & Media** from the sidebar menu of the pop-up screen. It is at the very bottom.
3. Choose the “**Website Link App**".

4. Give your App a name. This is how you will find this App among your Content.
5. Paste the target website's link in the URL field. For example: Let's say you would like to show the homepage of the BBC: <https://www.bbc.com>

**Note for SoC Players:** Some websites have a setting called X-Frame Option which can block SoC Players from presenting a specific URL. Click [here](https://gf.dev/x-frame-options-test) to test your URL and find out if the page you want to show has any X-Frame Option restriction.

6. There are many Advanced Settings should you require them.

7. “Save” the App. You can now [create a campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nE9NcVuKhM) to add the app in or directly display it on screen.

Adding interactivity
--------------------

By default, the URL App will block user clicks. Check to "Allow user interaction" if you want the user to be able to navigate on the shown web content.

### Additional App Notes

* The page will be opened using your Player's browser, hence rendering may look different compared to your desktop. We suggest you test the final look on the target Player before deployment.
* Some pages may have a particular security setting preventing it to be opened in the Preview of the Website Link App. We recommend to test it on a Player before actual deployment.
* It is important to **understand the target web page's terms of service and copyrights to avoid breaking any licensing agreements**.
