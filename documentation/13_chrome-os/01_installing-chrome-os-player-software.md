Installing Chrome OS Player Software
====================================

Taking advantage of Google Chrome Device Management, you can remotely install and configure OnSign TV to run in Kiosk Mode.

Running OnSign TV in Kiosk Mode will:

* **Auto start** OnSign TV every time the device is powered on.
* Prevent users from getting out of OnSign TV (Kiosk Mode).

Here is how to install the OnSign TV Â Player Software on a Chrome OS device:

1. Go to the Google Admin console.
2. Click on the upper-left corner and follow the path Devices > Chrome management > Settings. The Chrome Management will open.
3. Click on "Device settings".
4. On the newly loaded page, scroll down to the Kiosk Settings box. Click on "Manage Kiosk Applications".
5. Click the Chrome Web Store and search for OnSign TV. Click to add the application to the "to install" box.
6. Confirm with "Save".
7. Back in Kiosk Settings, expand the Auto-Launch Kiosk App drop-down menu and select OnSign TV.
8. Enable device health monitoring.
9. "Save" at the bottom-right of the page.
