Setting GeoRegions
==================

OnSign TV offers features to trigger and limit Content playback to GeoRegions. For example Content can be triggered when crossing a geographic delimitation. For this purpose, you need to define the areas beforehand.

1. In your OnSign TV account, select "[Geographic Regions](https://app.onsign.tv/geographic-regions/)" from the menu.

2. Click on the “New” button in the top-left corner.

3. Name the region and draw the area on the map.

   * Search for a country, state, city, or other places by typing in the text field on the map.
   * Use the zoom in and out button on the top-left of the map to adjust the map section. Alternatively, you can roll the mouse’s scroll wheel.
   * Use the tools on the top-right to draw on the map. With the arrows button you can slide around the image. The circle allows to mark average areas by once clicking at a center and then drawing a radius of the circle. But we recommend the polygon tool (indicated by the triangle) if you intend to determine concise and irregular areas. With the polygon tool, you start with a click on the mouse and draw lines. Each click is another anchor point. Finish with a complete area.

   * Once you have completed a full drawing, you can move corners of the cutout by double-clicking on it. Then edit the cutout by clicking on a corner, dragging the appearing dots to adjust the shape, and then releasing it.
   * Right-click on a layer to delete it and begin a new drawing.
   * It is possible to have several areas marked as one GeoRegion.
4. Hit “Save” when done.
5. You can already set this region to play back a [triggered Content](/triggered-playback/using-georegion-trigger). Create as many regions as you need. To create new GeoRegions click on the "New" button and repeat the process.
