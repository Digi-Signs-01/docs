Using QR Code Trigger
=====================

Combine two OnSign TV tools – QR code App and on-demand publishing – to let viewers interact with your products and content!

How does it work?
-----------------

You can present Content in full-screen or in a region of a Campaign Layout and add a QR code App so that the viewer who wishes to obtain more info can do so. Learn here how to use the QR Code App.

When scanning the QR code, OnSign TV will trigger related Content on the display, besides also triggering a web page on the cellphone browser.

Step-by-step
------------

1. Create Content with the additional info you wish to trigger.
2. Save & Publish as [on-demand](/triggered-playback/playing-on-demand-content). It is possible to set a web page which will trigger on the user's cellphone (*optional*).

3. After publishing the on-demand Content to the Player, copy the URL from clicking the little chain icon next to the start playback button. Paste it somewhere. You will need it later! You can find this button on Player's "Content in Player" page under the Triggered Content header.

4. Now, create the basic Campaign to which you wish to add the QR code App. You can of course also directly publish the QR code App in full-screen.
5. Add the copied on-demand URL to the QR code App ([learn how to create QR code App here](/popular-apps-setup/using-qr-codes)).

6. Publish the Campaign with the QR code App to the Primary Playback Loop.

Let users scan it and this will trigger your on-demand Content! It will also immediately redirect your customer's phone browser to the URL of your choice.

**Note:** You can also generate QR code from a free online QR code generator with the on-demand Content's URL and print it. Attach it next to a product and each time somebody scans it, the Content will be triggered on the screen.
