Using GeoRegion Trigger
=======================

If your screens are on the move and the location around your Content matters for context, trigger Content to be published when entering or exiting a certain location.

Content triggering by GeoRegion is the tool you are looking for.

We have shown you [how to set up GeoRegions](/triggered-playback/setting-georegions) in a previous tutorial for reference. In this tutorial you now learn how to set the trigger to your Content.

1. First, create Content. For this example we will use a Campaign.
2. Next, publish your Campaign, for example by clicking on the "Publish" button in your Campaign Editor. Now, you are in the Publish menu of your Campaign where you see where the Campaign has already been published, if it has been. Click the orange "Publish" button on the top-right.

3. Select a destination "Player" moving it from left to right.

4. In the "**Playback Restrictions**" section, select "**Play only when...**" and then check the option "**Play only on players inside ANY of these locations**". If you have previously set up your GeoRegions, just type the name of that region into the text box. Click "Apply" to save.

5. If you don't have the region set up to your needs yet, you need to set up a new region or modify the existing one, click on the "Manage Geographic Regions" button and follow the steps [to set a GeoRegion](/triggered-playback/setting-georegions).
6. When finished, you are redirected back to your Content publishing settings. Confirm with the orange "Publish" button at the bottom.

7. Your Content will now be triggered every time your moving screen enters "Region A".
