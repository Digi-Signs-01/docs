Pausing on-demand Content
=========================

In this tutorial, you learn two methods to pause [on-demand Content](/triggered-playback/playing-on-demand-content). This is especially useful with indefinite on-demand Content where the Content was set to repeat indefinitely in an infinite loop.

For this tutorial, we assume you have already triggered the on-demand Content. If you don't know how to do this yet, check out the tutorial [Playing on-demand Content](/triggered-playback/playing-on-demand-content).

1. Select the Player where you have triggered the on-demand Content and go to the "Content in Player" menu.
2. Scroll down to the "Triggered Content" header.
3. There are two ways to stop playback of on-demand Content.

### Stop playback immediately

Hit the "Stop On Demand Playback" button in the Triggered Content header.

### Stop playback at a later time

In this case, you can save a URL and share it with the person in charge of stopping the playback.

1. Click the down arrow icon beside the "Stop On Demand Playback" button.

4. Lastly, paste the URL into the browser of any device to stop the playback. It does not require any authentication. This allows you to share this URL with other people in charge of the signage.
