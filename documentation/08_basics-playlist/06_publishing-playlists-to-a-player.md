Publishing Playlists to a Player
================================

Follow the next steps to publish Playlists to a Player. If you don't know what a Playlist is, go to back one tutorial and learn [how to create a Playlist](/basics-playlist/creating-a-playlist).

1. Go to the Content page of your OnSign TV account and into your Playlist Folder where you saved your Playlists in.
2. Right-click on the to be published Playlist and choose the “Publish” button or while you are in the process of creating a Playlist, you can already click on the "Save and Publish" or "Publish" button from within the Playlist Creator.

5. Confirm with “Publish” at the bottom of the page.
6. The Playlist has been successfully published! To edit any publishing settings, click on the pencil icon to the right of the Player thumbnail. You reach this page when you select "Publish" from a Playlist menu, like demonstrated in step 2. Alternatively, you can also look for the Playlist in the [Content in Player](/basics-publishing/managing-published-content).
