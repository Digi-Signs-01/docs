6. Confirm with the "OK" button on the pop-up window.

### Important Notes

Transitions and animations **WILL NOT** work if:

* "Use HTML Webview legacy" is enabled in the Player Settings (Android only).
* "Safe mode for video playback" is enabled in the Player Settings (Android only).
* Using an old device with a not powerful enough CPU. To ensure your hardware runs smoothly and stable, we highly recommend testing the usage of transitions on a sample device for at least 24hrs before publishing it to a large number of Players.
* If "Disable Transitions" is marked in the Player Settings. You can also take advantage of this feature to disable transitions on specific Players you don't want transitions to run on.
