Creating a Playlist
===================

Instead of publishing individual media files or Campaigns to Players one by one, you can gather them together and publish all of them at once.

A Playlist makes **publishing** and **ordering** Content much easier.

2. A new Playlist creator opens. Give the Playlist a name.
3. In the info box you can also set the Folder to which the Playlist will be saved, set Categories and Tags as needed. You can also set a default duration for images added to the Playlist Loop. The initial setting is to 10 seconds, but you can modify it to your preference, as well as [adjust particular durations](/basics-playlist/adding-files-media-and-apps-to-a-playlist) for individual images in the Playlist Content box further below.

4. Scroll down and select the files, Compositions or Campaigns you want in your Playlist. Drag them from the left to the right or click on the arrow icon. Move the content up and down to adjust the order of your Playlist Loop.
