Add restrictions to Playlists
=============================

This tutorial will show you how to add a restriction to a piece of content in a Playlist. It is different from [adding a restriction to Content which shall apply to all Players](/basics-publishing/adding-restrictions-to-content) and it is also different from [setting a restriction at publishing to a Player](/basics-publishing/basic-content-publishing).

1. Select a Playlist from your OnSign TV account.
2. In the Playlist Content box, click on the clock icon to the right of an item to adjust its restriction.

3. Choose whether to actively allow or to deny playback based on a restriction.

4. Let's say we want to show an item at a specific location. Select "Play **only when...**" and then a the Location identifier.  
   Please note, we are using the Logic Mode for restrictions. There is also a Visual Mode which works in the same way, just looks different.
5. Now, set where the Content item shall play. You can choose if the Location shall be inside or outside a region. Click on the **Manage Geo Regions** button to create this geographic region.

7. With the **Back** button you return to the Restrictions page. There you select the geographic regions created one by one. Use the **+** button to add a new geo region. Check the logic operator between the location. Select the **or** operator to all content to play when the Player is inside any of the geographic regions.

8. You can add other Logic Groups, for example for time or dates. Click the green **Add Logic Group** button and select **Time ... is between**.
9. When you have set all restrictions to your needs, finish with **OK**.

Note that when applying these settings, the selected Content will play only in the geographic regions between 8am and 6pm each day of the week.

10) Each restricted Content will display a clock icon in orange. The settings just apply to the item you have edited, even if the item is duplicated in the Playlist.

11) Click **Save** or **Save and Publish**.

Note, a restricted item on a Playlist is still downloaded to all Players where the Playlist is published. It will however not play back.
