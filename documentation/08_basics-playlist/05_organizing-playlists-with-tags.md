Organizing Playlists with Tags
==============================

Organize your Playlists with Tags! Classify your Playlist in a way which makes sense for your operation, e.g. according to region, content, target audience, or anything else which fits your purposes!

Besides Categories, you can add Tags to certain items in your OnSign TV account. This helps to find them more easily. If you are drowning in content, no doubt tags are there to help you! Besides [searching](/create-your-first-campaign/searching-campaigns-by-tag), you can also [publish more quickly](/basics-publishing/publish-tag-filtered-content) than ever!

Tag Playlists
-------------

1. In your OnSign TV [account](https://app.onsign.tv/content/), create or edit a Playlist.
2. The Tags box is found directly below to the Playlist Name, if you have a desktop view of your account. Just type in the text you want. You can add as many tags as you need by placing a comma between different tags (,) or by using the tab key. The platform will suggest tags you have used before as you type (see image below).

You can also tag Â [Campaigns](/create-your-first-campaign/organizing-campaigns-with-tags) and [Players](/players/organizing-players-with-tags).
