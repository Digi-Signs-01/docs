Adding files, media and Apps to a Playlist
==========================================

Pack a bunch of files into a Playlist Loop!

Playlists are a great way for organizing and packaging your content. Once a Playlist is created, they can be published to a single Player or a Group of Players. With the help of restrictions, you can easily publish one Playlist to your whole network in one single step while only showing the right content at a location.

### A Playlist can be built with:

1. Media files or Apps
2. [Campaigns](/create-your-first-campaign) and [Compositions](/media/using-dynamic-composition)
3. Other already created Playlists

**Note:** Media files and Apps directly added to your Playlist will always play on full screen.

This is how to organize files in Playlists:

1. In your OnSign TV account, go to the Content page and click on "New".
2. Select the option “Playlist”.
3. Fill out the basic info as needed like Playlist Name, Folder, Category, and Tags. All but the Name are optional.

4. Scrolling down, use the left box to select Campaigns, Playlists, or content media files.
5. Drag the selected file or App from the left into the Playlist Content or click on the arrow button. Move them up and down if you want to change the order.

   Click on the gear icon to the right of an item to adjust the display duration for images, Apps, and other files with no duration of their own.  
   Video files are by default set to full length duration. In case you wish to modify the duration, you can also adjust them via the gear icon. Campaigns don't have the gear icon because they play for their full duration.
