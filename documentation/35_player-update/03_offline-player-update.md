Offline Player update
=====================

Keep your Players updated to get access to all of the newest OnSign TV features and enhancements.

This is possible even in environments with poor to no internet connection. Follow the next steps to load the newest App version on an offline Player:

1. For the first step you will need an internet connection. Take a device which is connected to the internet and download the latest OnSign TV  Player App version for your Operating System available on OnSign TV [download page](https://onsign.tv/downloads/). Save the file on a USB memory stick or other external storage device.

2. Plug the USB memory stick into your offline Player and open the App installer. The App name varies according to the device. In Minix, for instance, it is “Apk Installer”.

NOTE: **DO NOT UNINSTALL** your previous OnSign TV version from your Player. If you do so, you will not update the OnSign TV Player App, but remove and install a new. As a result, you will need to publish all of your Content to the Player once again.

3. Click “Install”.

4. Click on “USB Disk”.

5. Install the Application file.
