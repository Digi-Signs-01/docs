Remote Player update
====================

OnSign TV’s development team is constantly working on improving your digital signage managing experience.

Updating your Players gives you access to enhanced services and new features added to the OnSign TV platform. Even if you don't see the notification, it's worth checking if there is a Player update available if you have not set your Player to [update automatically](/player-update/automatic-player-update).

Follow the steps below to update the Player software for Windows, Android, and other devices.

1. Click the Players [tab](https://app.onsign.tv/device/) on the left side of your OnSign TV account.
2. Select all Players which you want to update.
3. As you select, buttons will appear on the header. Click the “Update Software”.

4. Confirm the action in the prompt.

5. The dialog box will inform you that the Player is being updated.
6. When the update is ready, the message will vanish.

Why can't I update my Android Player?

In some cases you won't be able to update your Player:

* **SPM not installed or non-rooted Android device:** If your Android device does not have the [SPM (Signage Platform Module)](https://onsign.tv/spm/) installed or is not rooted, you have to [update the software manually](/player-update/manual-player-update) from the OnSign TV [website](https://onsign.tv/).  
  The Android operating system does not afford certain privileges to regular applications. The SPM – given that your device is compatible – or rooting the device gives the OnSign TV  Player App an admin status to, among other things, update the Player remotely.
* **Google Play Store App:** If you use the Google Play Store App, Google does not allow remote software update. You have to update it through the Google Play Store. You can also save time and set the Google Play Store to update the OnSign TV software automatically:
  + Access the Google Play Store on your device.
  + Search for the OnSign TV  Player App.
  + On the top-right corner, click on the three dotted icon and check “Auto-update”.

Note that automatic updates for the Google Play Store App are very delayed when compared to the Android system version. The Google Play Store App is convenient for testing the OnSign TV  Player App quickly. For your full operation, we recommend downloading the app directly from the [website](https://onsign.tv/android-overview/).
