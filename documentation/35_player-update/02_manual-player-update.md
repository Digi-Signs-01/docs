If at trying to update your OnSign TV  Player App, a pop-up shows up on your screen with the message that the Player could not be updated, it means your device does not have the OnSign TV Systems App or Signage Platform Module (SPM) installed. These software packages are necessary to allow advanced features of OnSign TV on your device, including remote update. Not every device model supports these packages.

If you don’t have a device with these capabilities, follow the next steps:

1. On your device's local browser, open the OnSign TV [download page](https://onsign.tv/downloads/).
2. Download the latest version of the OnSign TV  Player App available for your Operating System.
3. Install the App on your device again. The software will be updated, keeping all the already published Content on the Player.
