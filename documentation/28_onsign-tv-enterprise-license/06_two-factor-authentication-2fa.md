Two-factor authentication (2FA)
===============================

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your OnSign TV account by requiring you to enter a code from your smartphone in addition to your password. OnSign TV uses the industry-standard Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm (TOTP) to generate these codes, which is also used by companies like Google and GitHub.

There are many free TOTP code generator apps available for both iOS and Android, such as Google Authenticator, Authy, and Toopher. During 2FA setup, OnSign TV also generates a set of 10 one-time backup codes. These codes can be used if you lose access to your smartphone or the TOTP app stops working. Backup codes can be regenerated at any time, but each code can only be used once.

Here is a step-by-step guide to enabling 2FA on OnSign TV:

1. Download a TOTP code generator app to your smartphone ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&pli=1) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)).
2. Log into your OnSign TV account and go to your **Settings**.
3. Select **Account Security**.
4. Click the **Enable Two-Factor Authentication** button.
5. Click the orange button **Enable Using an App**.

7. **Enter the code** generated by the app in the One-Time Password field.

Once 2FA is enabled, you will need to enter a code from your smartphone in addition to your password whenever you log in to your OnSign TV account.
