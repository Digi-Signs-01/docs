Audit log
=========

This feature is exclusive to Enterprise Plan subscribers

The Audit log is a dynamic report which automatically tracks all user activities on the platform. An essential tool for compliance and information security, it provides a detailed record of all tasks performed by every user, including the username, executed task, date and time, IP address, and estimated location.

### Audit Logs can be used to:

* Monitor user activity to identify unusual or suspicious behavior. For example, if a user is accessing sensitive data or performing privileged actions outside of normal business hours, this could be a sign of a security breach.
* Investigate incidents by providing a timeline of events leading up to and after a security incident. This can help to identify the root cause of the incident and prevent it from happening again.
* Demonstrate compliance with regulations. Audit logs can be used to prove that the organization is properly monitoring and tracking user activity.
* The audit log can provide additional information which may be helpful for troubleshooting problems and identifying areas with room for improvement.

To access the Audit Log:

1. Click on the **Platform logs** tab on the bar menu on the left.
2. Click on Audit Log in the header of the page.
