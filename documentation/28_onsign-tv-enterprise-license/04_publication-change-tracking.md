Publication change tracking
===========================

Publication tracking is an optional setting which only organization admins can enable. Once enabled, it requires all users to enter a description whenever they:

* Publish new Content
* Change published Content

Publication tracking helps you to:

* Track Content changes over time,
* Understand what was changed, when, and why,
* Promote accountability, as each change to a live published Content is associated with a user and will include a change description.

### Steps to enable Publication tracking:

1. Click on your username to open the **Settings** of the bottom-left menu.
2. Click on **Organization Settings**.
3. Go towards the end of the page and set the **Publication Tracking** as needed.

When the publication tracking is enabled, the following pop-up window will be shown to users when changing, publishing, or changing an already published Content.
