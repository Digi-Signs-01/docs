Enterprise platform backup
==========================

The OnSign TV Enterprise plan includes a comprehensive and robust solution for protecting your data. In addition to other security features, OnSign TV executes an extensive platform backup of all data. This is part of the OnSign TV Business Continuity Plan, so we can ensure minimal to no data loss in case of a severe disaster taking place.

### OnSign TV Enterprise backup employs the following strategies:

* **Full database backup:** A full database backup is executed daily. This ensures that you have a complete copy of your database in case of data loss or corruption.
* **Incremental database backups:** Incremental database backups are executed every 3 hours. This ensures that you have a copy of any changes which have been made to your database since the last full backup.
* **Database backups distributed to at least a second geography:** Database backups are distributed to at least a second geography. This means that your data is protected from regional disasters, such as floods or earthquakes.
* **Daily backups kept for 7 days:** Daily backups are kept for 7 days. This allows you to restore your data to a previous state if necessary.
* **After 7 days, a weekly backup is kept for up to 30 days:** After 7 days, a weekly backup is kept for up to 30 days. This gives you a longer-term backup option in case you need to restore data from a previous week.
* **All media is stored in at least 2 redundant locations:** All backup media is stored in at least 2 redundant locations. This means that your data is protected from data loss due to hardware failure.
