Playback restriction by Tags
============================

If you keep the (good habit) of [tagging Players](/create-your-first-campaign/organizing-campaigns-with-tags), you can benefit from it during Content publishing. You can prevent Content from being played on tagged Players, or only publish to them.

For instance, let’s say you are a digital signage provider and distribute advertisements within your network, which include different restaurant chains. It certainly would be a problem if you published a restaurant or fast food chain advertisement to the wrong establishment.

Learn how to use Tags to avoid this mishap:

1. Right-click on the Content's thumbnail on your Content page and select “Publish”.

2. In the new page, click “Publish” on the top-right corner.
3. Select several Players or a Player Group to publish the new Content to and move them to the right box.
4. Now, focus on the section “**Playback Restrictions**". By default, the option "Play with no restriction" is enabled. Select the option "**Play only when**" and at the bottom of the page select "**Play only on players that have ALL these tags**". Fill in with some Tags used by some of the Players.

### Players which have these Tags

If you select this filter, you can publish to as many Players as you want, but it will play back only on the devices which contain all the Tags you type into the box.   
This filter could be used to prevent a menu board from playing at the wrong restaurant. This is a menu board for John’s Restaurant, not Mike's. So, I can insert a "John" Tag to make sure it only plays on his screens.

**NOTE:** If you add multiple Tags, the playback will only work on devices which contain **ALL Tags combined**.

### Players which don't have these Tags

This filter works the opposite way. When inserting a "Mike" Tag instead of a "John" Tag, the Player which does not have the Tag, will not play the menu board.

5. Click "Apply" and then “Publish”.

On the next page, the Players which received the Content will be listed. Those with the Content blocked due to a tag restriction will be marked. If you wish to remove this restriction, just click on the edit icon on the right and modify the filters.

One thing to keep in mind: Even though a Player which does not fall into the filter will not play the Content, it will still download it. Therefore in order to save space, use tags wisely, in particular on devices with limited storage space.
