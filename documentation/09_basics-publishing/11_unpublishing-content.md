Unpublishing Content
====================

You can unpublish Content from your Player in case they are outdated or have no longer any use. This frees up valuable memory on your device.

There are several paths to unpublishing Content, depending on the Content type.

The best overview you have from the Content in Player screen of the Player. This works for all pieces of Content: Playlists, Campaigns, Compositions, Apps, videos, and images.

1. Go into the Player and select Content in Player from the menu.
2. Look for the Content you want to unpublish and click the little check box in front of it.
