Publish Tag filtered Content
============================

New Player and nothing to play on it yet? Make Content publishing faster and more efficient.

As your digital signage operation evolves, you might find yourself looking for a specific piece of Content among hundreds, or scrolling down endlessly, looking for Content to fill your newly set up Player. Make this process quicker with tagging.

1. In your OnSign TV account, go to the Players tab on the left and select the device you want to publish new Content to.

2. Select "Content in Player" from the left menu. Then click the "Publish" button in the top-right corner.

3. On the newly loaded page, click on the magnifying glass icon to search. Type in a [Tag you have set on some of your Content](/create-your-first-campaign/organizing-campaigns-with-tags) in the search field and klick enter. For this tutorial, we chose to publish several pieces of Content using the Tag "test", "test1", and "test2" to a Player.

4. Select the pieces of Content given out by your search and click the round button in the middle to move the content to the right. You can also double-click on an item to move it to the right. In case you want to add further Content to the device, clear the text field and search for another piece of Content by Tag or by name.
