Pausing Content playback
========================

In the event you notice a mistake in an already published piece of Content, you can click a "Pause" button, so that it won’t be displayed in any Player while you're on it. This allows you to correct it without being in a hurry.

There are several paths to pausing Content, depending on the Content type.

Pause in Player view
--------------------

You have the best overview from the Content in Player page of a Player. This works for all pieces of Content: Playlists, Campaigns, Compositions, Apps, videos, and images.

1. Go into the Player and select Content in Player from the menu.
2. Look for the Content you need to briefly pause and click the little check box in front of it.
3. In the header, you will see color-coded buttons.

4. Click the yellow "Pause" button.
5. Confirm that you want to pause this Content.

6. Your Content is paused. To unpause it, click on the check box again and select the green "Resume" button in the header.

Pause a Campaign or Playlist
----------------------------

Campaigns and Playlists have the option to also be paused directly from within the Campaign or the Playlist editor without the detour of going into the Player.

1. In the Campaign or Playlist editor, select “Publish” from the menu.
2. Click the yellow “Pause Campaign” or respectively "Pause Playlist" button on top of the list of all Players this Campaign or Playlist is published to. Note, this action will pause the Campaign or Playlist on all Players.

4. The Campaign or Playlist is currently not playing anywhere. As soon as you have corrected the mistake or make the changes needed, you can come back to the same page and click on “Resume Campaign” or "Resume Playlist" respectively.

Pause Campaign or Playlist from Content page
--------------------------------------------

Campaigns and Playlists can also be paused from your Content page.

1. Go to your Content page.
2. Right-click on the Campaign or Playlist.
3. Select "Pause" from the pop-up menu.

5. In your Content overview, you will see a little pause icon on the top-right corner of the Campaign or Playlist.

To resume your Content, trace your steps back: right-click on it again and select the "Resume" option.

Pause Content in Player Groups
------------------------------

You can also take advantage of Player Groups to quickly manage your Content. This resembles the same way as pausing Content in the Player view, already laid out above.

1. Click on the Player Group tab in your OnSign TV account.
2. Select the Player Group the Campaign is published on.

3. From the Player Group menu on the left, choose “Content in Group”.
4. Select one or more pieces of Content you wish to pause.
