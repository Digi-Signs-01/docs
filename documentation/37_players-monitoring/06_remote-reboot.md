Remote reboot
=============

If your Player hardware starts to show limitations, such as constant crashes, use an advanced feature to reboot the device from the convenience of your OnSign TV account instead of having to manually reboot the device. All you need is an internet connection to access your OnSign TV account. It is certainly handy, particularly if you manage a digital signage network with several locations and cannot reboot devices manually.

This feature is primarily available for Android devices compatible with the OnSign TV [Signage Platform Module (SPM)](/android/signage-platform-module-spm).

1. In your account, select the device from the “Players” tab.
2. Click “Settings” on the menu on the left.
3. Click the “Reboot Player” button on the top of the page. You will have the option to "Reboot the Player" or "Restart the Application". "Reboot the Player"!

5. The device will start to reboot. This action will be listed in the [Player Status](/players-monitoring/monitoring-events) as “**Player rebooting as requested**”, followed by the event confirming that the “Player booted as requested”.
