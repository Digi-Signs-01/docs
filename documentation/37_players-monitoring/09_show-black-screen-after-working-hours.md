Show black screen after working hours
=====================================

OnSign TV  Players can show Content at all times. When there is no Content scheduled, they will display a default logo, but you can also turn screens black outside of the defined working hours. To set up the screen working hours, follow the steps below:

1. Click on your username at the bottom-left of your OnSign TV account. Select the “Settings” from the drop-down menu.

2. Choose the “Default Player Settings” option from the menu.

3. Scroll down to the “Working Schedule” section. In the box “When outside of working schedule”, change “Keep playing campaigns” to “Turn screen black”.

4. Define which Players or Player Groups this setting of turning the screen black should apply to by clicking on “Apply”.
5. Right below the command, set the days and hours of the working schedule, meaning when the Players should be on. The command to turn the screen black will apply to the times outside of this working schedule.  
   If there are different working hours for each day, click on “Add Another” and fill the settings. For instance, if you have a late night event on Tuesdays and want to set a Player to function from Tuesday 20pm to Wednesday 3am, you have to create two different rule sets for each day:
   * Tuesday: 20:00 to 23:59;
   * Wednesday: 00:00 to 03:00.  
     Remember that you won't receive email alerts in case something goes wrong with your Player outside of these working hours.

6. Confirm with the “Save Settings” button at the very bottom.
