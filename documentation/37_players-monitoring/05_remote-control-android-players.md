Remote control Android Players
==============================

Control your Android Player through your [OnSign TV account](https://app.onsign.tv/device/).

Besides [remotely viewing the Player](/players-monitoring/remote-view), you can even control it through the same page on your OnSign TV account. With this feature, you can access Apps and change settings.

1. Click on the Player tab on your OnSign TV account and choose a device. This feature requires a rooted Android Player or with an installed System App ([SPM](https://onsign.tv/spm/)).
2. Select “Remote View” from the menu on the left.
3. On the new page, you will see the current display of your Player. Navigate through the Player using the buttons in the header which simulate commands on your device:

   * Click the “Back” button to return.
   * Click the “Home” button to check your applications.
   * Click the "Rotate Screen" button to rotate your screen view clockwise by 90º.
   * Click the "Send Text" to send a message to your Android device.
   * Click on the screen with the mouse to simulate touch. If you wish to scroll, click and drag the mouse cursor as you would do on your Player with your fingers.
4. After completing your task, do not forget to open the OnSign TV  Player App before leaving the remote view page!
