Monitoring Events
=================

Keep track of everything happening with your Player at the time it is happening. Each time your Player connects to the Wifi, all updates from the Player will be reported chronologically in the Player Status as Player Events.

1. In your OnSign TV account, click on the “Players” tab on the left of the page and select a device.

2. The newly loaded page will directly show the "Player Events" box on the first page, right under the Player Status header. It will display all activities of the Player, such as connecting to the internet, downloading files and synchronizing Content, files, and playback rules. This kind of information will be shown on white background, while errors will be highlighted in red and warnings in yellow.
