Set email notification for errors
=================================

Nobody can monitor every screen at all times. Therefore, the system monitors them for you. The email notification feature notifies you in case of an error on a Player.

This is how you set up email notifications:

1. Go to your OnSign TV account "Settings" by clicking on your username at the bottom-left and choosing Settings.
2. In the menu, you find the section "Default Player Settings". Click on it.
3. When you scroll down, you'll reach the "Email Notification Settings" box.
4. Add the email address you want the notification to be sent to. You may set several emails. Make sure the box "Notify When an Error Happens on This Player" is checked. Then click on the Apply button.

5. This opens a pop-up window where you can decide for which Players the notifications shall be sent. Click on the line "Add these emails to the existing email list of each Player". This is the same way you would proceed to unsubscribe an email address from the Player error notification. Click "Apply".

6. A pop-up window will tell you that your settings were applied. Click "OK" and leave the Default Player Settings by confirming with "Save Settings" on the very bottom-right of the page.
