Remote View
===========

You can check what is playing on your screen at this very second from the convenience of your [OnSign TV account](https://app.onsign.tv/device/)  without even leaving your desk.

You do not only get to know the name of the Content which is currently shown, you can also actually see the Content playing. Find out how!

1. In your OnSign TV account, click on the Players tab at the left side of the page.
2. Select which Player you want to preview.

3. On the next page, you will already be informed which Content is playing in a little box on the left called Now Playing (see image below). This is what the server informed the player to play. But we want to go further than that. Choose the “Remote View” option from the menu.
4. The new page will load the mirrored image of your screen. It might take a few seconds for it to load. The image is updated every second making it easy for you to keep track of the Content.

5. If your Content is in portrait orientation, you can click the “Rotate Screen” button on the top-right to watch the remote view properly.
