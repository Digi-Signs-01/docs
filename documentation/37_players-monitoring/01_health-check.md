Health Check
============

Health Check is a powerful and convenient tool for finding and fixing issues across your network.

### The Health Check will inform you about:

* **Advice to install the OnSign TV SPM** - Players where the OnSign TV SPM should be installed for enabling advanced features: like [remote view](/players-monitoring/remote-view), [remote control](/players-monitoring/remote-control-android-players), [scheduled reboot](/players-monitoring/remote-reboot), and [remote upgrade](/player-update/remote-player-update).
* **Expired Content** - Content which is published with an [expired restriction](/basics-publishing/publish-content-with-restrictions). This Content won't be shown any more, but is still using valuable storage space on the Player. The Health Check will only highlight Content which is expired for more than 48h.
* **Invalid Apps**
  + Due to an invalid parameter.
  + Due to either invalid or empty feeds.
  + Due to missing [integration Accounts](/account-settings/connecting-social-media-accounts).

Different from a static reports, the Health Check will run a new scan every time it gets loaded.

Example Health Check Issues
---------------------------

### SPM - Installation Advised

The Health Check scan found that the “Lobby Player” can take advantage of advanced features by installing the [OnSign TV SPM](https://onsign.tv/spm/).

Suggested actions:

* Click on the "Download SPM" button.
* Save the downloaded content on a USB Drive.
* Install the SPM on your Android Player.

**IMPORTANT** - The SPM APK is custom built for each Android Distribution. The "Download SPM" button will provide the right SPM version for the specific Player listed. Android will block the SPM installation if the SPM version is not the correct one for the target Player.

### Content Published with an Expired Restriction
