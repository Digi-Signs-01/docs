Campaign cycling
================

Item cycling is a Playback Mode on a Playlist. This feature allows you to control how many items of a Playlist play each time the Playlist comes up in the Playback Loop.

In order to follow this tutorial step by step, check out [how to create a Playlist](/basics-playlist/creating-a-playlist) and [how to publish it](/basics-playlist/publishing-playlists-to-a-player) beforehand. Then continue to read the instructions below:

1. Go to the "Playlist" folder of the Content page of your OnSign TV account.
2. Select a Playlist.
3. Beside the Tags text field, you can see the “**Playback Mode**” field. Upon selecting "Cycle Items", a field named "Count" will appear. In this field, you type the number of items you want to play back each time it's the Playlist's turn in the Playback Loop. For instance, note down 1.

4. Confirm your changes with "Save" or “Save and Publish” on the bottom-right corner.
5. Cycling is now set! This is how it looks like in the Publish menu of the already published Playlist. See how it says “Showing 1 campaign at a time.”

6. Let's check how it appears in the Playing Loop in the Player. Select "Players" from the bar menu on the left, and select the Player recently used.
7. Go to the "Content in Player" menu. We have here two Campaigns and a Playlist which contains three Campaigns A/B/C (not explicitly shown).

8. Now, click on "Playing Loop". You will see the following:

On your OnSign TV platform, the Playing Loop shows one item of the Playlist in sequence with the other two Campaigns following. Every time you look at the Playing Loop, you will see Campaign A/B/C > Campaign 1 > Campaign 2.

On your Player, each time the Playlist comes around, one single Campaign will be displayed instead of the whole Playlist at once. The Player will playback this content setup as follows with Campaign A, B, and C belonging to the Playlist.

**Note:** You will not get this view in your platform. It is solely meant to illustrate how the Player will behave when Campaign cycling is set.
