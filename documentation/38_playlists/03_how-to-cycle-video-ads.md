How to Cycle Video Ads
======================

Add videos to your Playlists and activate the Playback Mode Cycle Items to cycle through different content per loop.

The easiest way to manage ads and make sure content doesn't repeat itself unnecessarily is having multiple Playlists. Another tip is to group content together by categories and alternating between content categories. Cycling items is another neat tool.

In this tutorial, we show you step by step how to create and publish a Playlist with diverse ads to your device.

1. On the Content page, click “New”.
2. Select the option "Playlist" from the drop-down menu.
3. Complete the Playlist settings. For more information, check the full tutorial on [creating a Playlist](/basics-playlist/creating-a-playlist).
4. At the bottom of the page, you find two divisions: On the left is all the content from your account. On the left is the frame where you configure the content sequence of your playlist. Select your ads and drag them to the board.

5. With restrictions **set the active period of your ad Playlist**. If your ad should be shown only until a certain hours of the day or during a specific period, you can set a restriction by clicking on the **clock icon** next to an item.

6. To **cycle the ads**, use the Playback Mode at the top right of the Playlist editor. Change the Playback Mode to Cycle Items and set a count for the number of items you want to cycle each time the Playlist is played.

7. [Publish the Playlist to your device](/basics-publishing/basic-content-publishing) and add more restrictions or settings as needed.

In this example, we published this Playlist with 4 video files to a device which already has two other Campaigns published normally. Every time the Playlist will be displayed, only one piece of content of the Playlist will be displayed at a time, since the value in the Cycle Items Count was set to “1”.
