Creating complex Playlists
==========================

In this tutorial, we explore another use of Playlists which, combined with [Campaign Cycling](/playlists/campaign-cycling), will make your digital signage even more dynamic.

You already know the benefits of publishing Playlists instead of Content one by one to a Player and [how to create them](/basics-playlist/creating-a-playlist). You simply group your Content into the desired loop.

You can also build complex Playlists containing other Playlists. By inserting whole Playlists into Playlists instead of singular Content, you make Content management simpler as you create longer loops with less individual items. This way, you achieve a better overview of what Content is in a certain Player.

1. From your Content page add a new “Playlist”.
2. Fill out the basic details, such as Name and the optional Category or Tags. Choosing the Playback Mode [Campaign or Item Cycling](/playlists/campaign-cycling) is optional.
3. Now scroll down. Your content will be listed in the left box. Browse for the Playlists you wish to add to the loop.

4. Drag and drop the Playlists to the Playlist Content box on the right. Arrange the order you want to display them.
