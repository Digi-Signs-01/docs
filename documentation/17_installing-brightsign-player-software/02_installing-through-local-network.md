Installing through local network
================================

Requirements:
-------------

* Use a USB stick or an empty FAT32 or ExFAT SD Card. If the storage device is not empty, the installation process will not work!
* Make sure the Player's ethernet cable is connected so that the Player can obtain an IP address.
* You will need a computer connected to the same network as the Player to access the BrightSign Player web interface remotely.
* BrightSign firmware 8 and up.
  + Devices with older BrightSign firmware which had the PlayerPlayer version 3 installed will still work with the installation done as described in this tutorial, but from OnSign TV version 10 onwards, you need the BrightSign firmware 8 and up.

Set up & Install the OnSign TV Player App
-----------------------------------------

1. Have your Player's HDMI connected to a display.
2. Disconnect the power cable.
3. Press and hold the "Reset" and "SVC" buttons simultaneously while you connect the power cable to the BrightSign Player at the same time.
4. **Release the buttons once the red "ERR" light starts to blink fast**. The BrightSign menu will load on the screen with more instructions.

**IMPORTANT!** Remember to have an empty storage device connected to the Player!

5. Wait while the **Player boots**.
6. The BrightSign menu will appear on the screen with instructions.
7. **Using a computer or tablet**, open a browser and enter your Player's IP address. Include `/setup` after the IP address, example: `http://10.0.35.116/setup`. If asked, the default username is 'admin' and the password is the device's serial number which can be seen in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
8. In the browser, click on "Next".
