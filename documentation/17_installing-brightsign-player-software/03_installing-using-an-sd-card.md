Installing using an SD Card
===========================

THIS METHOD IS NOT RECOMMENDED.

While this is an easy and convenient installation method, this setup does not allow to configure the Players' network and timezone settings.

Installation steps:

1. Download the file: <https://brightsign.onsign.tv/autorun.zip>.
2. **Copy the ZIP file** into the root folder of an **empty FAT32 SD Card**.
3. **Put the SD card** into a BrightSign device and **power it on**.
