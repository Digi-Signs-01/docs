Installing BrightSign Player Software
=====================================

OnSign TV can be installed on the following BrightSign Players:

   BrightSign Series 3 (LS3, HD3, XD3, XT3)  
   BrightSign Series 4 (LS4, HD4, XD4, XT4)  
   BrightSign Series 5

There are three methods to install the OnSign TV  Player App on BrightSign.

1. [Through BSN.Cloud](/installing-brightsign-player-software/installing-using-bsncloud-preferred-method) (preferred) - This option allows remote installation and additional remote Player settings through the BSN.Cloud.
2. [Local Network Installation](/installing-brightsign-player-software/installing-through-local-network) - Requires a computer connected to the same network as the BrightSign device.
3. [Copying installation files onto an SD card](/installing-brightsign-player-software/installing-using-an-sd-card) (not recommended) - While this is a convenient method, this will not allow to configure important Player attributes such as network settings and timezone information.
