* SSSP Portrait HDMI IN playback only works after playing at least one video
* SSSP Video is always rendered below the HTML layer, which means the video will not be -displayed if a fullscreen image is added to any of the timelines.

* webOS Remote view is supported in Portrait mode, however, videos are not rotated properly when taking the screenshots, meaning they'll appear rotated.
