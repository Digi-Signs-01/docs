Installing Philips D-Line Player Software
=========================================

OnSign TV supports Philips D-Line Series Displays. In this tutorial, you will learn how to access the Android interface and install the Player App on your device.

1. Turn your monitor on. If this is the very first time, you need to set the language and configure the connection according to your preference.
2. Wait until the Philips sign vanishes.
3. Press the "Home" button on the remote control and enter the digits 1 8 8 8.
4. The Android menu will open on the screen. From this moment on, you can install the OnSign TV Â Player App just like you would do on any Android device ([Read the complete tutorial](/android/installing-android-player-software)).

**Note:** Do not forget to install both, the OnSign TV Android Player App and the Philips Signage Package Module (SPM). The SPM is specifically built for your device and will give you access to OnSign TV's advanced features, such as remote view, control, and scheduling reboots.
