Detaching a hardware device through Android menu
================================================

While it is always possible to detach a player through OnSign TV platform, it is also possible to disconnect the hardware device directly on the Player side.

Follow these steps to detach de player on Android device:

1. If the OnSign TV Player is running, right-click or press the Android back button to exit the Player. Uncheck the "Remain connected upon exit", as this will ensure the Player app is not running in background.

2. This will take you back to Android screen.
3. Go to Android settings and search for **Accounts**. The screen below is only an example, as the Android menu differs depending on the Android version and distribution.

5. Remove the account by clicking the three dots at the top-right corner and choose "Remove account".
6. This will disconnect the player from your OnSign TV, so the next time the OnSign TV is loaded a new paring code will be shown.

As the hardware device is now detached, it can be connected to another player license, or even other OnSign TV account.
