Using external storage
======================

Using an external storage such as a SD card, or USB drive is a handy way to extend the original hardware storage.

Important - Make sure to use a reliable and good quality external storage device, to avoid storage to get corrupted. A corrupted storage may freeze your hardware.

Follow the steps below to start using your external storage:

1. Connect a SD card, or USB drive to the Player.
2. Go to your OnSign TV account and click on the “Players” tab. Select the Player to which you have connected the external storage.

3. Select “Settings” from the menu on the left.
4. On the next page, scroll down to “Storage Settings”.
5. Select “Use External Storage”
6. Find out and enter your external storage device path. The path should look something like mnt/external\_sd or mnt/external. However, the path is different across devices and might be different on the one you use. If you don't know the external storage path, there are step-by-step instructions at the end of this article.

7. Finish with “Save Changes” at the bottom of the page.

Finding the External Storage Path
---------------------------------

1. Connect your external storage to the Android device.
2. Open the file browser app, usually this is called “My Files”, but depending on the manufacturer, it may have a different name.

Note that in this case, we were not given the path to the SD card itself, but the path to a folder within the card. This is good enough. We simply need to remove the last part of the path to get our result: /storage/extSdcard.

If you have your external storage connected to a device, but you couldn’t find an external storage map, don’t worry. Some devices don’t show or don't even have a native file manager app.

In this case, we recommend downloading the Explorer App from Google Play Store, and follow a similar process as presented above to find the external storage path.

With your external storage path in hand, change your Player's storage settings the external storage.

If after all you can't still find your external storage device, make sure it's properly connected and formatted with a filesystem that Android supports.
