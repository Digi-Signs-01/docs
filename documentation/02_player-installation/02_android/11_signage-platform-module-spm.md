Signage Platform Module - SPM
=============================

To support a larger number of hardware partners and enhance compatibility for Android 5 and up devices, we introduced the OnSign TV SPM together with the OnSign TV Player app version 6.0.0.

When visiting our download page you will notice there is only one OnSign TV version. This application is compatible with all Android devices 4.1 and above. This is the right choice when installing OnSign TV on new devices!

Instead of having a separate “OnSign TV System” version like before, we built an additional App called [SPM – Signage Platform](https://onsign.tv/spm/) Modules – for each of our hardware partners. These modules will unlock advanced functionalities on your Players and will serve as an extension to OnSign TV.

If you own a device manufactured by IAdea, Philips, Geniatech, Minix, Mele, and many other partners, you just need to install the OnSign TV App and the corresponding SPM.

### Can’t find your device brand?

Try installing the SPM for OEM Android devices.

This version works with a great number of generic Android hardware devices, so it is worth a try!

### How to enable the advanced features in case none of the SPM options can be installed on my device?

Root your device and OnSign TV will detect root capabilities automatically, enabling the advanced features.

### How do I check if my Player has these Advanced Features enabled?

Click the “Players” tab on the menu on the left.

Click on the target Player name.

Look if the “Remote View” option is accessible in the sidebar menu.

### I already have several Players deployed using the OnSign TV System version. What should I do?

Don’t worry. Although we are not creating a direct link to the System Version available, we will keep updating it. This means you will get the updates and will be able to either manually, or auto-update Players through the OnSign TV dashboard.

### What version should I use when deploying new devices?

You should use the latest version of OnSign TV and install the corresponding SPM – Signage Platform Module.

We highly recommend either using an OnSign TV SPM compatible hardware or using an Android rooted device. Both options will enable OnSign TV Advanced Features, greatly improving remote player management and signage network reliability!
