Installing Android Player Software
==================================

In order to reach your content goals, you need to show them! You need: a Display, a Player device, and the proprietary Player App. The OnSign TV Player App changes based on the Operating System of your device.

If your Player runs on the Android Operating System, you need to install the Android Player Software.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [OnSign TV website](https://onsign.tv/) and hover over "Training & Support" in the header. The menu unfolds and you can click on "Download".

2. Select "Android" on the newly opened page.
3. [Download the Player App](https://app.onsign.tv/download/player/latest/android) and install it on the device.
4. If you have a **Minix, iAdea, Zidoo**, or **Philips D-Line** device, you can additionally download and install an SPM, which stands for [Signage Platform Module](https://onsign.tv/spm/). It is an OnSign TV extension which enables advanced features like remote view, control, and scheduling reboots on devices of the mentioned manufacturers. Click on "Download SPM" and select your manufacturer.

* If you don't have a device of one of these manufacturers or your model number differs, try to install the Signage Platform Module (SPM) for **"Other Android Devices"**. Not every firmware is compatible with this version, thus your installation may not be completed. It is worth to try!

If the device is rooted, there is no need to install SPM.

Alternatively, you can install OnSign TV from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.onsign). This version is compatible with Android 4.2 and more recent. If you choose this installation method, you will only be able to update the OnSign TV software with the Play Store approved features. To benefit from all features OnSign TV offers, we recommend to get the Player App from our [web page](https://onsign.tv/downloads/). This way you have full control over updates and get the newest features right when they come out!
