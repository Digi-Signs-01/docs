Installing on webOS 2.0 to 3.2
==============================

Installing the Digisigns App on your LG webOS Signage screens is really simple and easy!

This tutorial is **applicable to all LG webOS 2.0 and LG webOS 3.0 professional signage displays**:

* **webOS 2.0** – SM5B, SM5KB, SM3B and UH5B.
* **webOS 3.0** – SM5C, SM5KC, SM3C and UH5B.
* **webOS 3.2** – SM5D, SM5KD, EG5CD and EJ5D (Compatible with [firmware 04.00.60](/02_player-installation/19_lg-webos/08_updating-lg-webos-firmware) or newer).

WebOS 2.0 and webOS 3.0 devices can only run the Digisigns app up to version 3.3.x. Only webOS 3.2 and newer can run the newer OnSign player app from version 10.x.x.

If you wish to set up Digisigns on LG webOS 4.0 or higher, [check out this tutorial](/02_player-installation/19_lg-webos/03_installing-on-webos-40-to-60).
