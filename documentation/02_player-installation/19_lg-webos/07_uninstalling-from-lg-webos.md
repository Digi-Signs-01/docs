Uninstalling from LG webOS
==========================

Once installed, the Player runs automatically every time the webOS device is powered on. That's just how the webOS Signage operating system works.

To remove our player from **webOS 3** devices, follow these steps:

1. Press **HOME** on the remote control to open the app drawer;
2. Navigate to the OnSign TV Player icon (if never moved, it can be hidden outside the screen on the far right of the app drawer);
3. Once the icon is selected, press and hold the OK key. This will enter the edit mode;
4. Press UP on the remote. A small bubble with the X mark should appear right above our Player icon.
5. Press OK to confirm and restart the TV (power it off and back on using the remote).

To reinstall our Player, you can follow the steps from [this tutorial](/lg-webos/installing-on-webos-20-to-32).
