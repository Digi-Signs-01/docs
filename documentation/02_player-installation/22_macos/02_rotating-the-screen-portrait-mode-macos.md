Rotating the screen (portrait mode - MacOS)
===========================================

Rotating the screen on MacOS is quick and simple:

1. Launch the System Preferences from the Apple menu.
2. Hold down the Cmd + Alt keys and click on the “Displays” icon.
3. On the right side of the Display preferences, look for the newly visible ‘Rotation’.
4. Set the rotation you want. Here, you probably want to rotate 90° for the display to go into a vertical page layout orientation.
5. Close out the System Preferences to have the settings go into effect.
