Installing Linux Player Software
================================

Requirements:
-------------

* Intel x86-based PC
* 2GB of RAM
* 32GB of storage
* Ubuntu **18.04** or **20.04**

Installation procedure:
-----------------------

On a clean Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04:

1. [Download the installation file for Linux](https://app.onsign.tv/download/player/linux/) .
2. Open a Terminal window on your Linux PC.
3. Enter the commands in the following sequence:
   1. sudo apt-get update
   2. sudo apt install ./FILE.deb (Substitute "FILE" using the **installation file name** downloaded in step 1)

Done, the OnSign TV Â Player App is installed and will be available to use. In the next step, [connect the Player to your account](/basic-player-operations/connecting-a-player).

Additional Settings
-------------------

Before sending your Player to the field, here are a few additional settings we recommend for reliable and smooth operation:

1. Make sure your Linux is configured for auto-login.
2. Make sure that screen lock and screen saver are disabled.
3. Disable Linux System Notifications.
4. Make sure Linux auto-update is disabled.
5. Make sure you are using the latest video driver for your graphic card.
