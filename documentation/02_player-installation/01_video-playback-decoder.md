Video Playback Decoder
======================

Video Playback Decoder Option
-----------------------------

This option is available to:

* OnSign TV [Windows Players](/Windows)
* OnSign TV [Linux](/Linux)
* OnSign TV [macOS](/Macos)

**Note** – Only change this settings in case you are experiencing Player crashes or video playback instability.

OnSign TV can use different Video playback strategies and this will change the path video decoding and rendering is executed. By default, the Automatic option will be selected and OnSign TV will select the best option based on your graphic card and video driver version.

Video decoding is tightly related to your video graphic card and the video driver installed on your Player. Each decoding option will use a different strategy, this can result in better performance or stability depending on your software hardware settings.

* **The safe decoder** is a bit slower because all decoding is performed through the software, but it’s a lot more reliable.
* **The hardware decoder** is usually faster, but its stability will depend on your GPU and video driver’s implementation.
