Switch to Digisigns from Samsung Magic Info
===========================================

To switch between Samsung Magic Info and other apps (like the Digisigns app), follow these steps:

1. Press the "Menu" button on the remote control to open the device menu
2. Navigate to "System", and look for "Play via".
3. Click the OK button on your remote control to go into the options. Select an option other than "MagicInfo". If any app is already installed on the device, the name of the app will be displayed, like Custom App in the image below. Otherwise, "URL Launcher" will appear instead.

During the first setup (when the TV is fresh out of the box), or after a factory reset via the service menu, one of the wizard options is also to choose from where to play content (URL Launcher or MagicInfo).
