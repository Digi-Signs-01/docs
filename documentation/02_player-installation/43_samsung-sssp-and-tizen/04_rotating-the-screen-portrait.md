Rotating the screen (portrait)
==============================

The Samsung Smart Signage Platform (SSSP) requires a new installation and adjustment of settings on the TV menu for Portrait Mode.

Besides setting a Portrait Layout when creating a Campaign or Composition or uploading a piece of Content formatted in Portrait Mode, you need to adjust the settings of the Samsung Smart Signage Platform to showcase your Content in Portrait Mode. After creating your Content, follow the steps below and you’ll be quickly done:

* If this is the first time you install the Digisigns App on your SSSP, please skip the uninstallation step mentioned next.
* In case you previously had the Digisigns App installed or Samsung Magic Info, you will need to uninstall either of the two before continuing. To uninstall a previously used software like Magic Info please refer to [this tutorial](/samsung-sssp-and-tizen/switch-to-onsign-tv-from-samsung-magic-info).

Portrait HDMI-in playback only works on the **second generation of SSSP** after having displayed at least one video file.
