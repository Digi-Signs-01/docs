Updating SSSP2 and SSSP3 Firmware
=================================

Manual Firmware Update with Regular Menu OSD
--------------------------------------------

Updating the firmware on Samsung SSSP2 and SSSP3 devices from the regular menu OSD is very easy. Just make sure you have your firmware update file on a USB and it is plugged into the LFD. Then you find the menu options through the following path:

* **Menu > Support > Software Upgrade**

After selecting Software Upgrade, follow the steps on screen. After the screen detects the newer firmware update on the USB, it will prompt you to confirm that you want to upgrade. Then, it will begin the update process.

**Make sure to not interrupt the LFD while it is performing the update or you will risk corrupting the software on the LFD.**

In order to update the LFD via the regular menu OSD extract the downloaded firmware files to a USB directory in such a way that there is a folder on the root directory of the USB matching the name of the displays main micom firmware, e.g. “T-GFSLAKUC” or “T-GFSLDWWC”. The name identifies the type of firmware. By matching the name, you can find the correct files.

**NOTE:** Use only 1 firmware update file per USB at a time as a precaution to not provide the wrong files, especially for Sub1-3 Micoms.
