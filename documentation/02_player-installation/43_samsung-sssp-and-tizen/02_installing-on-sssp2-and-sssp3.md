Installing on SSSP2 and SSSP3
=============================

This tutorial will guide you through the installation process of the OnSign TV  Player App on Samsung Smart Signage Platform devices of the 2nd and 3rd generation. These devices can only run the OnSign player app up to version 3.3.x.

Learn how to install OnSign TV on newer [Samsung Tizen Screens](/samsung-sssp-and-tizen/installing-tizen-player-software).

Requirements

Besides having an OnSign TV account, you need a 2nd or 3rd generation Samsung Smart Signage Platform LFD (Large Format Display). Once you have the device in hands, you need to determine its current state:

* If your device has Samsung's Magic Info software activated, you first need to reset your LFD to its factory state. This is done by going to **Menu ­> Support ­> Reset All** on your SSSP device.

Please note, that this option is not accessible while running the Magic Info software. A simple way to fix this is by going via a different Input Source (e.g. HDMI1, DTV, etc).

* If your device is running a different software via the URL Launcher, check out the last section of this tutorial ([Uninstall](https://onsign.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OTT/pages/edit-v2/30179434?draftShareId=56759d3c-8700-4e69-ba78-1d282f710ac7#Uninstall)) before continuing.
* If your device currently has no other software installed, continue as follows.

Note that this only removes the installed software, but doesn't remove any media files which may have been downloaded during the previous use of the OnSign TV  Player. To remove all media files downloaded to your device while using the OnSign TV  Player, make sure all Content associated with it are unpublished. The Player has to be in the "No Content available" state before uninstalling the software.
