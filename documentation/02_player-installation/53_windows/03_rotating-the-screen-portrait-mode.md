Rotating the screen (portrait mode)
===================================

Adjust your screen to display portrait-oriented content properly!

OnSign TV offers portrait layouts and you can also [draw your own Custom Screen Layout](/create-your-first-campaign/how-to-create-custom-screen-layouts) when creating a Campaign. However, if you don't adjust the display settings on your device to Portrait Mode, your Content will remain in landscape orientation. The result is disastrous:
