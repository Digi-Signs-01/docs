Disabling Screen Saver and Power Saving
========================================================

When using a Windows PC as a Media Player, it is important to disable the Windows Screensaver and the Power Saving features to prevent it from stopping your Digisigns Signage Player.

Here is how to configure Windows 10 to not put your computer to "Sleep":

1. Type “Power Options” in the search box in the taskbar.

2. In the newly appearing window, click on “Change when computer sleeps”.
3. Select “Never” from the drop-down list for both, “Turn off the display” and “Put the computer to sleep” under the “Plugged in” column.
