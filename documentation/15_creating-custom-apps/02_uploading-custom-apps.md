Uploading custom Apps
=====================

**IMPORTANT:** Custom App import is not available to all users. Please ask the support team to enable this feature for your account!

Once you have created your own App, please follow these steps to upload and import it to OnSign TV:

1. **Compress all files** and Assets used by your App **into a ZIP** file.
2. **Upload the ZIP** file to your OnSign TV account folder structure.
3. Once uploaded, OnSign TV will expand your ZIP file.
4. **Locate and right-click your** "**.html**" file, then **select Import App**.
5. If required, enter the Custom App fields, so an App thumbnail can be created. Then **press "Preview"**.
6. Once the preview is shown, you will see a **"Save" button on the bottom-right side**.
7. If the App already exists, you can **either replace it with the new version or save it as a new App**.

Once imported, your **Apps will be available under the "Custom" category in the App Gallery for all users in your organization**.
