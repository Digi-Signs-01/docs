Displaying RSS Video Feeds
==========================

Displaying video feeds is the most effective and efficient way to decrease perceived waiting time!

Whether you operate digital signage in [hospitality](https://onsign.tv/blog/case-studies/hospitality-industry/), [retail](https://onsign.tv/blog/case-studies/digital-signage-in-retail/), or [healthcare establishments](https://onsign.tv/blog/all/uncategorized/digital-signage-healthcare/), all of them have something in common: lines. Avoid boredom with the most attractive content there is available online without the need to produce it yourself!

Learn how to add RSS videos to your Content:

1. Start on the Content page of your OnSign TV account.
2. Click the “New” button at the top of the page. Followed by selecting "App" from the menu options.
3. From the pop-up window, choose the “News & RSS Feeds” category of the sidebar menu.

   1. "Name" the App.
   2. Paste the video RSS "Feed URL". You can find RSS video feeds by television broadcasters, newspapers, and RSS service websites. For this tutorial, for instance, we used a sample RSS video feed from BBC world news.
   3. Check the “display only media currently on the feed” box.
5. Click “Save”.

Now, the video feed is available in your App Folder of your Content Library. Place it in a Campaign timeline and remember to adjust the duration of the App so that videos are not interrupted mid-play.
