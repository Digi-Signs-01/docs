3. Save the App.

That is all you need to display live TV alongside your digital signage content! Just add the App to your Campaign timeline or publish it directly in full screen.

**NOTE:** In case you play back HDMI input video together with surrounding content, make sure you display a single video at a time. Some Players don’t handle multiple video sources well.
