Using Media RSS Apps
====================

Use a Media Cycling or Media RSS App to rotate media from your Files or from RSS Feeds.

RSS stands for “*Really Simple Syndication*” and essentially is a format websites use to deliver new content. There are many services which provide digital signage content through RSS, such as Screenfeed. These Media Apps are an easy way to display regularly updated image content on your screens.

Check the different Apps below:

Name the App, paste the URL of the RSS Feed, and determine how long each media shall play. This App will display all media in a row, each of them for the time you set. The App duration has to be adjusted directly in the timeline.

### Cycling Media RSS

Display a single Content each time this App appears on the Timeline. Make sure to test this App before deploying to your whole digital signage operation and adjust the length of the App on the Timeline according to the average duration of the RSS Feed's content.

### Media Cycling App

It will reproduce a single media from your files – such as photo or videos – at a time for as long as the App is set on the timeline or your Playlist. In case you select multiple media items, a different file is displayed in each new Content loop. After all media items are displayed once, the sequence will restart from the first file.

To show the above Apps on your screens, follow the next steps:

1. In your OnSign TV account go to the App Gallery ([Creating an App](/apps/creating-an-app)).
2. Media Apps are found in two different locations in your App Gallery. In "News & RSS Feeds" you find the above mentioned RSS Feeds "Media RSS" and "Cycling Media RSS". In "Web & Media" you find the "Media Cycling App". Select the corresponding category from the sidebar menu or type "media" into the search bar.
3. Choose your App.
4. Add the RSS Feed URL. If you select the “Media Cycling App”, add the files you want to display into the App's media box.
5. Check how your App looks by clicking on "Preview". Hit "Save" and your App is ready to be published to your screens!
