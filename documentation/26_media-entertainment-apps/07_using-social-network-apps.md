Using Social Network Apps
=========================

Share content from the staples of social media with your audience. OnSign TV has many social networks in its App library. Learn how to add them to your Content:

1. First, you go to the App gallery ([Creating an App](/apps/creating-an-app)) where you create, edit, or use any App template.
2. Select “Social Networks” from the sidebar menu of the pop-up window.
3. Choose any Social Network App. When you have finished configuring the App to your liking, click on "Save" at the bottom of the App Configuration. Any time you work on a Campaign, Playlist or Composition where you want to use the App, the App can be found in the App folder in your Content Library.

### X (formerly Twitter) is no longer supported

X, what formerly was Twitter, made significant modifications to its platform’s API earlier this year, resulting in the disruption and malfunctioning of numerous services which relied on Twitter’s functionality. The revised API policy, along with its associated fees, have rendered it impractical to continue to support it.

In light of this situation, we propose exploring alternative solutions such as Social Media aggregation companies like [http://Walls.io](http://walls.io/), which can be effectively utilized alongside OnSign TV.

We recommend unpublishing all of the Twitter Apps from your OnSign TV account, as they will no longer have their content updated.
