Using YouTube Video App
=======================

YouTube is only one of several [Social Network Apps](/media-entertainment-apps/using-social-network-apps) available on OnSign TV. This App is a great way of sharing video on your digital signage without the need of uploading files to your OnSign TV account separately. It is even better if your company already has a YouTube channel full of content ready to be shown.

1. In your OnSign TV account, you can create an App separately or you you can create one while creating or editing a Campaign. In the Campaign editor you will find the same orange "New" button as directly on your main Content page. Then select “App” from the menu to open the App Gallery.
2. From the pop-up App Gallery where all of OnSign TV Apps ([How to create Apps](/apps/creating-an-app)) are shown, select “Social Networks”. Then, choose the “YouTube Video” App.
3. Fill out the settings for the App:

   * Give the app a "Name" to find it easily when adding it to your Content.
   * Insert the URL of the video. There are three display options: single video, playlist, and channel. Check the link format examples below the URL field.
   * Choose the video quality. Set it on “Auto” when your internet connection varies in strength.
   * Furthermore, you can enable subtitles, if they are available. If they are, you need to choose a language or set is as default.
4. Click on “Preview” to check if you have inserted the correct URL and that the video is playing. Then “Save” the App.
