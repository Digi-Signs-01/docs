Displaying streaming videos
===========================

Use the Streaming Video Link App to stream RTSP or HLS feeds on your Media Players. The App is available for Android and Windows.

1. On the Content page of your OnSign TV account, click on the "New" button and select App to get to the App Gallery ([Creating an App](/apps/creating-an-app)).
2. On the pop-up window, look for the "Web & Media" category which is at the very bottom. There you will find the Streaming Video Link App.
3. Select “Streaming Video Link” and fill out the fields:

   * **App Name:** Write down something easy to recall what the stream is about. This is how you are going to find this App on the platform to use it as Content.
   * **URL:** This App supports RTPS and HLS streaming formats. Note that HLS feeds are more robust.
   * **Interval:** If you wish to avoid black screens and crashing, increase the value on the feed. It will consume more bandwidth, though. If you want to disable this option, leave it at “0”.
4. "Save" the App. A "Preview" option is not available for this App.
