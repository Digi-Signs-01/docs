Creating a Data Feed from an External Source
============================================

A Data Feed can be created by importing and keeping data in sync from external data sources.

For now, the Data Feed can connect to:

* RSS
* CSV
* [Google Sheets](/data-feeds/google-sheets-as-data-feed-external-source)
* iCal
* Facebook
* XML
* JSON
* Instagram
* Twitter (*now called X, no longer supported*)

To create a Data Feed from an external source:

1. Go to the Content tab.
2. Click on the “New” Button.
3. Select “Data Feed”.
