Data Feed Content Moderation
============================

Data Feeds provide a powerful content moderation tool to only allow designated users to review and approve content changes.

If a user is working alone on a Data Feed, they will not see the content approval action menu. For shared Data Feeds it works as follows:

Data Feed Owners and Admins have full access to moderate content.

Data Feeds can be shared with Restricted users.

* New data entered or data changed by Restricted users will, by default, be marked with an orange exclamation mark to “Request Approval”.
* The Data Feed Owner or Admin then has to decide if they Approve or Reject the Changes.
* Restricted users can request from the Data Feed Owner to delete specific rows.
