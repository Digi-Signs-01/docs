Data Feed Introduction
======================

Dynamic content is perhaps one of the most important aspects for signage screens. While OnSign TV for sure can handle RSS, Facebook, Instagram, and other feeds, what if:

* You want to put an approval flow in place and moderate the content coming from a feed?
* Or you want to create your own Data Feed, curate it, and get input from other coworkers?
* Maybe you would like to use your RSS feed in an App designed for Facebook? Why Not?

With the “Data Feed” feature all of this is possible!

Think of a Data Feed as a spreadsheet where each column is a field which can be used by Data Feed [enabled Apps](/data-feeds/using-apps-to-display-a-data-feed). Once created, a Data Feed will look like this:

Data Feeds can:

1. Be **created from scratch**.
2. **Import data** from an external data source.
3. **Subscribe to an external data source**, so your Data Feed will be automatically updated when there is a change in the data you subscribe to.
