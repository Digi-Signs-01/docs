Creating a New Data Feed
========================

You can use Data Feeds to feed Apps or Dynamic Compositions.

To start a new Data Feed from scratch:

1. Go to your Content section of your OnSign TV account.
2. Click the orange "New" button at the top-left of the page.
3. Select “Data Feed”.

4. Give the Data Feed a name and select "Manual Data Feed". If you want a Data Feed from an external source, please [read this tutorial instead](/data-feeds/creating-a-data-feed-from-an-external-source).

5. Clicking on the orange "Create" button opens a new window.

As this is a new Data Feed, the first step is to configure each column of the feed.

| **Name** | Every column of a Data Feed must have a name. This is how you will identify the column in Apps. |
| **Type** | This defines the type of data entered into the column. Apps require specific data types as input. Check with the App you want to fill with this Data Feed what type of data it requests. |
| **Max text length** | This will add a restriction, so users entering information to the feed cannot exceed a maximum length. |
| **Optional** | Marking the field as optional, will allow users to leave blank fields, otherwise input is required. |
| **Note** | Easy to read notes help users understand the context of this column. |

6. Once you have at least one column set, you can start entering data into your Data Feed table.

7. If required, you can either edit or delete a column by clicking on the three-dot icon available on the top of each column.
