Using Apps to Display a Data Feed
=================================

The whole purpose of creating and curating [Data Feeds](/data-feeds/creating-a-new-data-feed) is to take advantage of its flexibility for presenting dynamic content on your signage screens.

Once your Data Feed is set and ready to be used, you can present the data on any Data Feed enabled App or on a Composition.

Data Feed compatible Apps are marked with the green "Data Feed Enabled!" banner as shown below and can also be found through the search box:

Important aspects to consider when using a Data Feed:

* Only Data Feed compatible Apps can be used with Data Feeds.
* The App will skip the entire Data Feed Row when the Data Feed has a blank column field for an input which is “Required” by the App.
* Data Feed fields must be set to the same data type “Required” by the App.

Exceptions to this rule are (Data Feed Field -> App Field):

* Integer -> Numbers
* Data & Time -> Date
* Date & Time -> Time
* Image -> Media
* Video -> Media
