Content update interval
=======================

By default, Players have a real-time content update enabled, so any content changes are immediately propagated and downloaded by all Players using that content.

The content download interval can be changed from real-time all the way up to 48 hours.

### Important

* Only Players set to real-time content update support remote view features.
* Players not set to real-time will be shown as offline for most of the time and will briefly be shown as syncing when content is being downloaded.

Here are the steps for changing the content update interval:

1. Click on the Player menu.
2. Select the Player on which you want to change the content update interval.

5. Confirm by pressing the “**Save Changes**” button.
   * Use the Download Restrictions option to have restricted Content be downloaded onto your Player only 3, 5, or 7 days prior to its expected playback dates.
   * Mark the "Days of the Week" when the Player will download the Content. The Player will check for updates on this schedule and at the frequency interval you defined. Next to the days of the week, you can even set start and end times.
