Download content ahead time
===========================

By default, Players download all content, regardless of the playback schedule or rules. This is useful to ensure content is available even when the device goes offline for long periods, but it can also take up storage space and use unnecessary bandwidth.

These three examples illustrate how this can have a negative impact on Players:

1. Players will download all content ahead of time, even if it is scheduled to play several months in the future. This can take up all of the Player's storage.
2. Players will download content even if its playback rule makes it impossible to play. For example, the Player name is X and the playback rule is "*don't play if the Player name is X*" or; The Player doesn't have the tag Y and the playback rule is “only play if tag Y is present.”
3. Published content will be kept on the Player storage until it is explicitly unpublished.

To address these issues, you can configure Player download restrictions. When you do this, the Player will only download content matching the Player's playback rules.

1. Following the settings, the content will be downloaded 3, 5, or 7 days ahead of its scheduled playback date.
2. The content will be removed from the player 48 hours after the last day it is scheduled to play, freeing up storage space.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to configure the Player's "Download restrictions".

1. Click on the Players tab.
2. Select the Player where you want to change the content update interval.
