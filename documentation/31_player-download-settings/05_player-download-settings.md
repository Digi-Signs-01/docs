Player download settings
========================

By default, Players are set to look for Content updates in real time. This means, any time Content is published or updated these changes will be immediately downloaded by the Players.

This behavior can be changed to:

1. Configure how often the Player will search for updates.
2. Configure the hours when the Players can download updates.
3. Configure how far in advance new Content will be downloaded.
