The Content page
================

When you log into your OnSign TV account, the first page you see is your Content page. Let’s get familiar with it.

![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731661763778/40223cee-1d54-4310-b482-0463c021f8e7.png)

On the left, you see a panel with different topics:

1. Content
2. Players
3. Player Groups
4. Dashboard
5. Health Check
6. Geographic Regions
7. Reports
8. Platform Logs

We will talk about the other topics in different manual sections. This one is only about the Content page. If you are on any other page, you can always return to this start page by selecting “Content“ from this panel.

There is a little icon on the top of this left panel which lets you collapse the panel, replacing the written out words by icons. In the collapsed mode you have more room to view your content.

Staying on the left, we look at the very bottom. Here is your name, email address, and a photo (if you uploaded one). Clicking on this will open a little pop-up menu.

The menu contains a link to:

1. your account settings;
2. your OnSign TV subscription;
3. the player app download area: [Download Signage Players](https://onsign.tv/downloads/;)
4. the tutorial collection: [Articles](/tutorials)
5. open a new email draft to the support desk;
6. sign out from your OnSign TV account.

The main area of the Content page consists of all your content. This big “Welcome to OnSign TV!” message at the center will vanish and make room for your content once you start working with your account. Content Folders are on top, and loose content items are shown at the bottom as thumbnails.

As a small detail, we colour-coded different Content types. Images are shown in a yellow hue, Videos in orange. Campaigns are pink and Playlists blue. Apps are purple, Data feeds are green, and Compositions are a light blue.

By default your content will be ordered numerically and alphabetically by name, starting with numbers and then letters. Right above the grey content area, with the word Name, is an option to revert the order to start from the end of the alphabet.

The area where you read “Content” to the right of the orange “New” button allows you to know where in your folder structure you are. By clicking on it, you can directly jump into a new location in your folder structure.

When we look at the right of the content area, there is a small icon in the shape of a grid. By clicking on it, a choice between the current grid view and a list view appears. In grid view, your content is shown in the form of small tiles with their name and a thumbnail.

![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731661933636/1406f0d4-bac3-4366-81f7-b3ec3bdeecb4.png)

In list view, the content will be presented with a very small thumbnail. the name, the last time it was modified, and the file size. At the header where you only could order your content alphabetically, you have the option to order your content by the last modified date or by size.

![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731661950827/db380e22-ccd8-4f33-af24-3bdddbb1c918.png)

Directly to the right of the grid/list view icon, you find another little arrow to allow you to (un)collapse additional space on the side. Select one content item by clicking on it or marking the little check box on the thumbnail in grid view or on the right in list view.

![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731661979891/9d32f3dd-1d6b-4ef2-b65b-8d606c3d1f52.png)

This area will provide additional information about the content. First, all available options for this content will be shown, such as publishing, but also deleting. Second, information about the content itself is shown, like the file size and dimensions.

If you scroll down on this uncollapsed view you can see how much storage space of your OnSign TV account you are using and how much is left. This information will be there even if you don’t select any content items.

![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731662000285/016a66ed-e2ee-4689-aff8-715ffbad5fb8.png)

Let’s collapse this area again. Looking up on the right is a search bar. This search bar is quite powerful. Not only can you search for content by name, you can also search only in certain folders, for certain content types, when approximately it was last modified, or its status, e.g. if it’s published.

![](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/23821/direct/1731662030050/130d7343-b19d-4f2a-a64d-30e9a82a8047.png)

At least. you may want to know how to add your own content to your account. Upload your images and videos by simple drag and drop onto the content area. Or you can click on the orange “New” button in the middle. There is an option to upload a file, but also several options to create one of the many content features OnSign TV is providing to you.

You will get to know these features more in detail in other tutorials. In short:

* App: OnSign TV has a large library of pre-designed and dynamic content widgets.
* Campaign: A Campaign allows you to segment your screen into several regions and fill each region with its own content loop.
* Composition: A Composition is a free form canvas which you can fill however you like.
* Data Feed: Data Feeds allow you to write your own database or integrate external data sources like Google Sheets and use as a source for apps or compositions to draw from dynamic information.
* Folder: Folders help you to keep your content tidy.
* Playlist: A Playlist is a full-screen loop of content
* Audio Playlist: You can have an audio track which is fully separate from your visual content.
