How to duplicate Content
========================

Copy Content to modify it.

Let’s say you play a piece of Content across different locations, but each location needs to have its local news displayed. For that purpose, it is easier to simply duplicate the Content, e.g. a Campaign, and solely replace the corresponding [RSS News feed](/popular-apps-setup/using-rss-feeds) of each duplicated Campaign.

You can duplicate **images, videos**, **Playlists**, **Campaigns**, **Apps**, and **Compositions**.

Use this duplicate action also if you want to do only slight modifications to the Content, but you don’t want to change the original Content because you will likely use it again in the future.

1. In your OnSign TV account, right-click on the thumbnail of the Content to be duplicated.

3. You can choose the Folder where it will be stored. The duplicated Content with the following name “XXX (Copy)” will appear instantly. Rename it so you know at a glance which modifications were done.
