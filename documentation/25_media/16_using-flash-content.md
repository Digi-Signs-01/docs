Using Flash Content
===================

**This article is deprecated as flash has reached its end-of-life on December 31, 2020 and is no longer supported**

The Windows version of the OnSign TV  Player App supports ".swf"-files, but requires installation of the Adobe Flash Player. Learn how to download below:

1. Access the [Adobe Flash Player](https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/) website.
2. Select your computer's Operational System version and followed by “FF 22 for Firefox – NPAPI”.
3. Click on “Download now”.  
   Adobe offers the installation of additional programs, but you don’t need to install them in order to download the Flash Player. Uncheck all you find unnecessary.
4. Open the downloaded file.
