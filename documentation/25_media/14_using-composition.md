Using Composition
=================

Design canvas with images, text, and shapes directly in OnSign TV.

Using "Compositions" you can create panels such as ads and menu boards, directly in your OnSign TV platform. Mix several elements to bring out beautiful designs and make your content stand out even more.

1. Click on the New button on your Content page and select Composition.

2. Select the image orientation and resolution. You can also set up a custom one. Alternatively, you can select one of many OnSign TV templates and edit these to your needs.

3. Now, you can unleash your creativity using the tools on the left side. They include text, shapes, stickers, media from your OnSign TV files, and more. Change each element's properties, such as opacity and size, and play with layers.

The new Composition will be placed together with your other media files on the "Content" page. You can edit it any time in the same image composer.
