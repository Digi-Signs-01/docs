Organize Content in Folders
===========================

Manage your Content easily and more efficiently with Folders.

As your digital signage operation grows, Folders are helpful to organize Content in accordance with your own structure. Combine this tool with [Content Tags](/create-your-first-campaign/organizing-campaigns-with-tags) and never take long searching for a specific item!

1. Click on the “New” button on the Content page of your OnSign TV account, followed by selecting "Folder" from the pop-up menu.

2. Write down an explicit name you can remember in the pop-up window and proceed.

3. Folders will be displayed on the top of the page, below the "Folders" header. Now, you can start filling Folders with Campaigns, Playlists, Files, Apps, and other Folders by simply dragging the Content to it.

You can switch from grid to list view to see more details about your Folders by clicking on the grid icon on the top-right. This way you can reorganize your list to be ordered by name, type, last modification date, or size.
