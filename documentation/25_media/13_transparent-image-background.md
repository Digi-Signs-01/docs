Transparent image background
============================

Out of all [image formats supported by OnSign TV](/media/supported-file-types), **.png** files have the option to be set to transparent or with a lower level of opacity. This feature is useful if you want to showcase the full background behind an image or add a frame to your Content. By comparing the two images at the end of this tutorial it will become clear.

1. Create or edit an image in your photo editor with a transparent background and save it as a **.png** file.

2. Create or edit a Campaign in your OnSign TV account.
3. In the "Screen Layout" section of the Campaign editor, click “Add Custom Layout”.
4. Add the [Screen Divisions](/create-your-first-campaign/how-to-create-custom-screen-layouts) which will fit the Content you want to add. At last, create an overlapping layer for the transparent image (Zone B of the image below).

5. Save this Layout by clicking on "Create Layout" or "Save Layout" if you adjusted an existing Layout.
6. [Upload](/media/how-to-upload-media-files) the **.png** file and drag it from your Content library to the overlapping zone’s Timeline ruler.

7. Finish editing your Campaign and check the Preview.  
   Without a transparent background, your Campaign would look like this.
