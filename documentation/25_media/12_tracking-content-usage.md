Tracking content usage
======================

Quickly browse where media Files, Apps, Campaigns, and Playlists are used and displayed.

To check out exactly where each of your files are displayed, you can visualize file usage in Campaigns, Playlists, and Players:

1. In your OnSign TV account, click “Content” on the sidebar menu.
2. Select any item in your account, be it a File, App, Campaign, or Playlist.
3. Right-click over the selected icon and select "Show Usage".

4. A new pop-up window will show where this item is displayed. There are two tabs which classify the playback as "direct" or "indirect":

* Direct Usage: This is the first instance you added this item.
* Indirect Usage: Here are other locations this item appears.

Let's go through two examples to make the difference clear:

Example 1: If you select to show usage for an **image** added to a Campaign and a Playlist which are published to different devices, on the "Direct Usage" tab you will see the Campaign and Playlist names, while the Players will be under "Indirect Usage" because the image is not directly published to the Player, but through the Campaign and Playlist.

Example 2: Now, let's say you have a **Campaign**, you published to one device but also added it to a Playlist to be displayed on another screen. Under "Direct Usage" you will see the Player on which you published the Campaign and the Playlist. Under "Indirect Usage" you will see the other Player which the Playlist is published to.

5. If you wish to remove the Content from any instance, you can click on the tile to go straight into the right page and edit from there.

* Clicking on a Campaign will load the [Campaign editor page](/create-your-first-campaign/how-to-create-a-campaign).
* Clicking on the Playlist will lead to the [Playlist editor page](/basics-playlist/creating-a-playlist).
* Clicking on a Player will redirect to the [Content in Player page](/basics-publishing/reordering-content).
