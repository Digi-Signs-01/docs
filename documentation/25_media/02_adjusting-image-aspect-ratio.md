Adjusting Image Aspect Ratio
============================

Rarely will you have an image which fits a Campaign's screen division exactly. Unless you crop the image beforehand to fit the screen, of course!

In all other cases, you will want to adjust the aspect ratio settings in your OnSign TV account.

1. Select a Campaign and look at its timeline.

2. Click on the picture item on the timeline.
3. A pop-up window will display the "Item Properties". Among other information, there is the “Aspect Ratio” field which contains four different options to fit an image.

**HINT:** Before choosing a setting, always take into account both, the screen size and the image aspect ratio (width x height). It is best to maintain approximate ratios instead of fitting an image into a completely different screen size.

Check below four image fitting options with examples. The screen area of this Campaign is 896x720px and all images are 1900x1200px. The original photos are shown on the left. Compare the photos to the result in the Campaign after the settings were applied.

* **Stretch to Fill Region:** This will make your image fit exactly to the screen area where it is set. It is ideal if image and screen ratio are approximately the same, because if the image size differs too much from the screen area, the photo will end up looking too stretched.

* **Keep Aspect Ration Without Resizing:** The photo will remain exactly as it is, without any distortion. The problem is, though, if you have a larger area on the screen than the size of the image, black bars will fill the blank areas around the image. On the other hand, if the photo is set to a smaller area, it will be cropped (see image below).

* **Fit Region Height:** Opt for this setting if the image has areas without important details you won't mind cropping from the image sides. In the example below for instance, the sky to the left was mainly cropped, but the most important element, the windmill, was kept intact. If you have a portrait image and the area is on landscape proportion, you might get black bars on the sides instead.

* **Fit Region Width:** Choose this setting if the image and the screen area have proportionally about the same width. If the image width is wider, black bars will appear on the top and the bottom (see image below). In case you set a portrait image to fit a wide screen area, the top and bottom will be cropped.

4. Confirm with “Apply” after you have adjusted the settings and thus save the changes in the Campaign.
