Supported file types
====================

You can upload the following supported files to your OnSign TV account:

* Videos (MKV, AVI, MP4, MPG, MPEG)
* Images (JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF)
* Web (HTML, CSS, JS)
* Flash animations (SWF)
* Fonts (TTF, OTF, WOFF)
* Archives (PDF, ZIP)

Check [this topic](/media/supported-videos-for-brightsign) if you are using a BrightSign device.

You can upload PDF as well as ZIP files containing multiple media. In this case, a Folder will be created with all the individual pages of the PDF or items comprised in the ZIP archive.

When you try to upload an unsupported file to the OnSign TV platform, you can check the "Upload complete" pop-up on the bottom of your Content page. It will show a yellow warning icon. Hovering over it will produce the message "file extension not supported".
