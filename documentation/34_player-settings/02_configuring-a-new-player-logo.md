Configuring a new Player logo
=============================

Increase your brand awareness even without any Content yet!

Every time you associate a new Player to the OnSign TV account, it will display the OnSign TV logo above the “No campaign available” message.

To not miss out on a moment of branding, this logo can be changed in the Player's settings.

1. Go to the settings of your Player.
2. Scroll down to more or less the end of the page until you reach the “Custom Logo” box.
3. Click on the "Change Logo" button and select the custom logo from your computer. An important note is the **logo file must be a PNG in the exact dimensions 682 pixels wide by 190 pixels tall**.

4. Click on "Save" to apply the changes to this specific Player.

You can change the logo any time by uploading a new one. You can also get back to the OnSign TV logo by clicking on the red button "Remove Logo".

Use the [Default Player Settings](/player-settings/player-default-settings) to configure a custom logo for all new Players or [to apply](/player-settings/configuring-multiple-players) a custom logo to all existing Players.
