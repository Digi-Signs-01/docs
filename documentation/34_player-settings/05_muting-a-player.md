Muting a Player
===============

Depending on the display location, visual-only information is exactly what you need.

What is the use of audio in a crowded place, such as a train station or a busy avenue? Probably not much but additional noise which does not add up to your Content. For those devices located in busy areas, simply adjust the Player settings to mute them.

### Mute a specific device:

1. In your OnSign TV account, click on the "Players" tab.
2. Select the device.
3. From the menu on the left, select “Settings”.
4. Scroll till you reach the "Player Settings" section. Check the “Mute audio” box. This will mute all Content, independently of their settings.

5. Note, that in a Campaign it is also possible to mute the content of specific screen layout zones. You can read about this in the [Campaign audio tutorial](/create-your-first-campaign/adding-an-audio-track).
6. Don’t forget to confirm to “Save Changes” at the very bottom before leaving the Player page.

### Mute multiple devices:

If you need to mute a cluster of devices, you can also apply this same setting to a Player Group.

Furthermore, you can also mute Players across your whole OnSign TV account:

1. Click on your username in the bottom-left corner of your OnSign TV account.
2. Select “Settings”.
3. From the menu on the left, select “Default Player Settings”.
4. This "Player Settings" section looks like the settings of an individual Player. Look for "Mute Audio". Mark “Mute Audio”. Then, click on the "Apply" button on the left to select the Players or Player Groups to which you wish to apply this settings to.
5. A pop-up window opens. Select "All Players" or specific Player Groups. Confirm with "Apply". The pop-up box tells you that the setting was applied. You can close it by clicking on "OK".
6. The page returns to the Default Player Settings. Confirm your setting at the bottom of the page with "Save Settings".
