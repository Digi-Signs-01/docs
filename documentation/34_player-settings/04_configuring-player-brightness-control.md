Configuring Player Brightness Control
=====================================

OnSign TV allows you to manage the brightness of your screens individually, in groups, and on a schedule. This is useful for screens which are outdoors, as you want them to be brighter during the day and darker at night.

To manage the brightness of your screens, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Players tab.
2. Click on the Player you want to manage.
3. Scroll down to the Brightness Control section and click enable.
4. To schedule the brightness of your screens, click "Add Another". This refers to rules.
5. Choose from what time to what time you want a different brightness intensity.
6. You can add as many schedules as you want, so you can have different brightness intensities for different times of the day.

### Why is brightness control important?

Brightness control is important for a few reasons. First, it can help your signs look their best. If your screens are too bright, they can be difficult to read or even cause glare. If your screens are too dark, they may not be visible at all.

Second, brightness control can help you save energy. By reducing the brightness of your screens when they are not in use, you can save money on your energy bill.

Finally, brightness control can help you comply with local regulations. In some areas, there are rules about how bright your signs can be at night. By using brightness control, you can make sure that your signs are in compliance with these regulations.
