Adding logos or footer (mask)
=============================

Let's say you have a logo and you would like to display it on every Content you publish.

AVAILABLE ONLY TO SELECT PLANS!

Well, for sure you can do this by adding the logo to all of your Content, but setting a "Campaign Mask" is a much easier and more flexible way to do it!

A "Campaign Mask" is a special attribute you can set to each Player, selecting a specific Content which will be displayed on top of all published Content on that Player.

The idea is simple! Imagine you cut a piece of paper and put it on top of your screen. First thing to think about is, you would need to leave open areas not to cover the entire screen. Therefore, leave transparent areas while creating a Campaign to be used as the Mask.

You can get [transparent areas either by using a PNG with transparency](/media/transparent-image-background), or by creating a Campaign which does not use the full screen. For this tutorial, we created a PNG image containing a frame and the OnSign TV logo:

Once the Campaign Mask is set to work like an overlay on a specific Player, this Campaign will always be displayed on top of all Content shown on the target device. To remove it, just clear the Campaign Mask setting from your Player.

How to set the Campaign Mask:
-----------------------------

1. Click on the Players tab.
2. Select the Player where you would like to add the Campaign Mask to.
