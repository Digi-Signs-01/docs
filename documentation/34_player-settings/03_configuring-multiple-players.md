Configuring multiple players
============================

There are many situations where it's required to change a specific setting for a large number of Players. To make it more tangible, let's imagine the goal is to change the working hours of 1,000 Players.

To execute this change:

1. Go to [Default Player Settings](https://app.onsign.tv/organization/settings/device/) menu in your Settings.
2. Adjust what should be changed, in this example the working hours.
3. Click on the Apply button immediately to the right of the box where you made the change.
4. Select the Group of Players this change should be applied to.

Illustrating the example for changing the working hours:
