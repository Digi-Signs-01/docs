Setting up Default Content
==========================

When [connecting a new device](/basic-player-operations/connecting-a-player) to your account, it will be empty at first. You need to [publish your first Content](/basics-publishing/basic-content-publishing) to show relevant Content on your screen.

You may have Content which is common for all of your devices, like a default company video. You can have it immediately shown on your screen when just setting up the screen for the first time. Of course, you can also set this basic Content up after you have already connected devices to the platform by editing the Player settings.

**Requirements:**

In order for this Default Content to be shown on your new screen, you must:

* [Create a Player Group](/player-groups/how-to-create-player-groups)
* Publish this basic Content to the Player Group.

Setting up Player Groups is a way of grouping screens which will receive the same media, thus simplifying Content publishing. All Players which belong to a Player Group will download the Content which is published to it.

The idea of a Default Player Group is that you indicate in a single step during Player setup to which Group the device belongs. This way, the new Player inherits Content from the Group and downloads it automatically. Saving you the step to separately modify the Player Group every time you expand your network.

For instance, in this tutorial we will set up the Content which should be featured throughout an Inn's network: all screens should display, no matter their location, information about the city's attractions and images of amenities.
