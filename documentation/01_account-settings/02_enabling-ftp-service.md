Enabling FTP service
====================

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol and is a simple network protocol which allows users to transfer files from their computers to a server.

You already use it when uploading files directly to OnSign TV via the browser, but FTP clients – softwares tailored for file transfer – offer further advantages, like scheduling, and queuing transfers, and more importantly uploading files larger than 2 GB.

Before downloading the program, first enable FTP transfer on your OnSign TV account:

1. Click on your username at the bottom-left corner and then on “Settings” on the drop-down menu

2. On the Settings page, select “FTP Settings” from the sidebar menu.

5. Done! Go back to your “Content” page. Expand the right-side menu by clicking on the tiny arrow next to the grid/list view icon which points to the left. Click on “FTP Info” at the very bottom of the page. All the credentials you need to use an FTP software are shown in the pop-up box.
