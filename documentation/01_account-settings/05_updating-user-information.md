* Full Name
* Email: To change your email address, click on the pencil icon to the right. This opens a new page. Type your new email address twice. A verification email will be sent to your email address. Check your emails and confirm the change.
* Timezone: This is the timezone of your account. It does not have any effect on the timezone of your Players. The Players timezones are determined by the device clock.
* Language
* Profile Picture (optional)

3. To change your password, choose Account Security from the menu on the left. You will have to type in your old password and provide the new one twice.
4. At the bottom of the page, you can delete your account by clicking “Remove Account”. Be careful and think twice before removing your account. **You won’t be able to restore any data** if you change your mind later.
