Offline Content Playback
========================

OnSign Players are designed to download all content before starting playback, ensuring that no media is played until it is fully available. Additionally, every file undergoes an integrity check to confirm it is complete and uncorrupted before playback begins.

This approach allows OnSign Players to never stop the scheduled content playback even if the internet connection is lost.

When the player is offline:

* It will continue playing the scheduled content without interruptions.
* All player and playback events are locally stored.
* OnSign Players can store up to 100,000 playback records.

Once reconnected, the player will automatically sync all stored playback and player events with the OnSign cloud, ensuring that reports accurately reflect playback history, including events that occurred while offline.

This guarantees uninterrupted playback and reliable reporting, even in environments with unstable connectivity.
