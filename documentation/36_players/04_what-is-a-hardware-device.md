What is a hardware device
=========================

**OnSign TV Hardware Device or Player Device**: is the equipment which provides the computer power, storage, and connectivity to install and run the OnSign TV  Player App. While traditionally the hardware device was a computer box, today hardware devices have evolved into different shapes and formats.

In many cases today, the hardware device is embedded in the screen as a System on Chip (SoC). This is the case for Samsung SSSP and Tizen, LG Smart Signage Platform webOS, Philips Professional Display Solutions, and many other professional signage display manufacturers.

OnSign TV is compatible with a large selection of operating systems and models. Depending on the selected hardware device, you will get different capabilities, such as CPU and computing power, video decoding resolution (for example, HD, 4K, or even 8K), remote view and remote player control, remote OnSign TV software upgrade, and the option to schedule screen on/off times.

The following definitions are used in the context of the OnSign TV platform:

* OnSign TV **Player** **App** or **Player** **App**: The OnSign TV Player App is a software application which must be installed on the hardware device. Once installed, it is responsible for connecting the device with the OnSign TV Platform, downloading, and presenting the signage content through the hardware device.
* **Player**: Once a hardware device is connected to OnSign TV Platform, we call it a Player. All Players can be viewed and configured through the Platform.
* **Display**: This is how we name the screen used to present the signage content. OnSign TV can be used with virtually any display, but the actual compatibility will depend on the hardware device used to run the Player App. Typical display types include LCD and OLED flat screens, LED panels, e-ink displays, and projectors.
