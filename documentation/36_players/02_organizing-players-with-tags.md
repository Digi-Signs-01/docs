Organizing Players with Tags
============================

Organize your Players with Tags! Classify your Playlist in a way which makes sense for your operation, e.g. according to region, content, target audience, or anything else which fits your purposes!

Besides Categories, you can add Tags to certain items in your OnSign TV account. This helps to find them more easily. If you are drowning in content, no doubt tags are there to help you! You can search with Tags and also [publish more quickly](/basics-publishing/publish-tag-filtered-content) than ever!

Tag Players
-----------

1. Click on the Players tab on the menu on the left-hand side. Select the Player you want to tag or set up a new device by clicking on the orange Setup Player button on the top.

You can also [create Player Groups](/player-groups/how-to-create-player-groups) and tag them. Players in a Group will automatically be assigned any Tag added to the Group.
