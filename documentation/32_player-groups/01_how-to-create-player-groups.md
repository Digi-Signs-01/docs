How to create Player Groups
===========================

Group Players together and publish Content faster.

When you reach a certain number of Players, Content managing can become confusing. How to make sure you are publishing the right Content to all the right Players? Player Groups is the answer! Combine Players with generally similar Content into Groups and speed up the publishing process.

1. Click on the “Player Groups” tab in your OnSign TV account.
2. Hit the orange “New Player Group” button in the top-right corner.

3. Name the new Group and add Tags to it how you see fit.

4. Click once on the Player you want to add to the Group. If you want to add multiple players, you can click on the box on the left. If you have a large quantity of Players on your account use the search box to find the Players you need.

5. After selected, you can click on the arrow or drag them to the right panel.
6. Confirm with “Save Group” at the bottom of the page.
7. Now is the time to start Content publishing! Player Groups behave the exact same way as Players do. For the first Content to be published to this Group, just click on "Publish to Group" next to the Player Group's icon and choose the Content and set the playback filters. It will apply to all Players within the Group.

Alternatively and for following Content publishing, click on the Player Group. Then select "Content in Group", followed by the orange "Publish" button. Choose your Content and set the playback filters.
