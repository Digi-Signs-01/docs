Using Audio Announcement App
============================

The Audio Loop requires Player version 10 or above.

Whether you are shy to speak up or haven’t mastered a particular accent just yet, but you need to communicate verbally with your audience, the Audio Announcement App has got you covered.

This TextToSpeech App allows you to write text content which is spoken as audio on the Player in a variety of voices and languages. At present, 100+ voices are available across 30+ languages.

1. To create a new App, go to your Content page.
2. Click the orange New button and select Apps.  
   You find the Audio Announcement App in “Other” category or by typing “audio” into the search box.
