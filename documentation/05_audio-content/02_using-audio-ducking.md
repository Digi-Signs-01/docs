Using Audio Ducking
===================

The Audio Loop requires Player version 10 or above.

This tutorial discusses the lowering of volume when a new, more important audio is temporarily introduced while another is still playing. To learn how to use audio files, please visit the [using audio files tutorial](/audio-content/using-audio-files).

Audio Ducking is a well-known feature to audio editors. Audio Ducking will lower, or “duck”, the volume of the media which are being played, allowing a new audio message to be heard. Once the message is finished, the volume of the previous audio is automatically resumed.

For example, if you have an audio announcement to kick in in the middle of a Campaign, you can adjust the volume of others to 30%. During the announcement the other volume levels will be reduced to 30% and after the announcement is done the main content is returned to the original level.

Audio Ducking can be configured for each element within a Campaign or Playlist which has a volume selector.

Two different volume levels have to be set:

* Volume – This is the playback volume for the media at hand.
* Volume Others – This is the volume set for all other media playing in the background.

Audio ducking can also be configured for on-demand audio playback.

1. Publish any audio asset as on-demand directly to a Player or Player Group. No Playlist or Campaign necessary.

2. Go to the Player or Player Group where the on-demand audio is published.
